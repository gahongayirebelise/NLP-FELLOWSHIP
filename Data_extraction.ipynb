Your microphone is working now.  \\n \\n \\nHon.  Ndindi  Nyoro  (Kiharu,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for  this \\nopportunity.  This  House  is  very  anxious,  and  our  country  is  paralysed  in  so  far  as  the \\ndetermination of the majority and minority sides in this House is concerned. The Speaker had \\nindicated that this House was expecting a Communication from the Chair so that we determine \\nthe  majority  and  minority  sides.  This  will  allow  us  to  continue  with  the  very  business  that \\nbrought us to this House.  \\n\\nI seek your guidance because the country cannot continue to wait in paralysis and this \\n\\nI seek your communication. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, hold your horses. We still have until 8.00 p.m. \\n\\nHouse cannot continue to wait in anxiety.  \\n \\n \\nThe session is not yet over.  \\n \\n\\n \\nNow, I will call upon the Member for… \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\nProceed now that you are on your feet. \\nHon. Junet Mohamed (Suna East, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. We stand \\nguided as per your communication. As you are aware, this is a House of record and procedure. \\nThe last communication that we heard from the substantive Speaker was that he would deliver \\na ruling on the issue of the majority and minority sides on Thursday, 6th October 2022 at 2.30 \\np.m.  It  is  in  the  Hansard.  The  Hansard  will  bear  me  witness  that  the  Speaker  pronounced \\nhimself on the Floor of the House that he would deliver his ruling at 2.30 p.m. It is now 2.44 \\np.m. We are late by 14 minutes. Maybe the ruling is not ready, or the law has taken its course \\nand wisdom has befallen the leadership of the House and they have realised that the Azimio la \\nUmoja-One Kenya Alliance is the majority side, so that we move forward. We need to move \\nthe country forward as my colleague, the Kiharu Member of Parliament (MP), alluded to. We \\nshould not keep the country paralysed nor Parliament in anxiety.   \\n\\nThe rule of law is very  clear, as lawyers say. The law is very clear. There are many \\nlawyers in this House, some of who are Senior Counsels. I think Hon. Murugara is here. The \\nlawyers are here. The law is very clear. So, can we authoritatively say that the decision has \\nbeen made in silence that the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance is the majority party in the \\nHouse, we move forward and conduct business as it is known in Parliament?   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Member,  you  are  out  of  order.  You  have  no  power  or \\nauthority to make a ruling on that point. The Hon. Speaker clearly communicated that he would \\ngive his ruling during this session that starts at 2.30 p.m. and ends at 8.00 p.m. Until we get to \\n8.00 p.m., we still have time. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n  \\nOrder, Hon. Members! We will proceed with the debate. I have put that issue to a close. \\n\\nWe will now proceed to continue with the debate. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   3 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMember for Lang’ata Constituency, you have the Floor. It is your turn.  \\nHon. Phelix Odiwour (Lang’ata, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First of \\nall, let me take this opportunity to congratulate you for having been elected the Deputy Speaker \\nof this House. I also take this opportunity to thank the people of Lang’ata for giving me the \\nchance to represent them in this august House. I thank Team Jalas that put up a very big battle. \\nThe battle for Lang’ata was not an easy one. I take this opportunity to also thank my party, the \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM),  and  my  party  leader,  Raila  Amolo  Odinga,  who \\nsupported me all the way to the end. I thank the teams from Mugumoini, Highrise, South C, \\nNairobi West, and Karen Wards. Most of the Members here are my constituents. Thank you \\nfor  your support. I take this opportunity to, again, thank my family that was with me in the \\nbattle.  \\n\\nI picked one thing in the President’s Speech that is very key for my constituency, which \\nis affordable housing. I am happy that the President is coming to  Lang’ata this week for the \\nlaunch of 4,500 houses in Zone B of Nyayo Highrise. I take this opportunity to tell the people \\nof Lang’ata to be ready. This project has taken long but it will finally come to fruition.  \\n\\nSecondly, I would like to talk about the Hustler Fund. I would like the fund to be given \\nto the Members of this House to care and be in charge of it. We campaigned with the hustlers \\nand we know them better than anyone else. We were with them.  \\n\\nI also want to talk about the savings that the President talked about. If the Hustler Fund \\nis coming, let the savings also be directed to the hustlers themselves so that they receive and \\nsave them on their own. Let them not be given to anybody else.  \\n\\nFor Lang’ata, I want to talk about stalled projects. We have a case in South C Market \\nwhere the land has already been allocated. They are just waiting for a few confirmations and \\napprovals  from  the county  government.  I request  the county  government  to  expedite this  so \\nthat work in that market can begin in earnest. I also thank the team that has been pushing for \\nMugumoini Market to start operating. Chairman Alois, I know you are watching. You asked \\nme to push for this market. The lawyers who are here, help us push for this market so that the \\nsmall battles we have in court can come to an end. We want this over and done with.  \\n \\nI  take  this  opportunity  to  tell  the  people  of  Lang’ata  that  the  issue  of  water  will  be \\naddressed.  Anytime  one  mentions  Lang’ata  everybody  talks  about  water.  The  Northern \\nCorridor Grid is already being worked on. We hope the water issue will finally end during this \\nterm  and  my  regime  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Lang’ata.  That  is  when  the  Northern \\nCorridor infrastructure is completed and we are gridded into it. \\n \\nruling that Azimio is the Majority in this House. That is when he comes here later.  \\n\\nFinally,  I ask the Hon. Speaker to, in his wisdom and wherever he is, make the best \\n\\nThank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n \\nI  donate  the  remainder  of  my  time  to  Hon.  Salasya.  He  had  requested  me  to  donate \\nsome two minutes to him. He had something he wanted to say. Hon. Salasya is here. Thank \\nyou. \\n \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  No.  You  are  out  of  order.  I  now  call  upon  the  Member  for \\n\\n \\nKigumo. \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   4 \\n\\n \\nHon. Joseph Munyoro (Kigumo, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. My name \\n \\nis  Joseph  Kamau  Munyoro  from  Kigumo  Constituency.  I  take  this  opportunity  to,  first, \\ncongratulate  the  Hon.  Speaker,  Moses  Wetang’ula  and  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  on  your \\nelection  as  the  Deputy  Speaker.  I  also  congratulate  our  President,  His  Excellency  William \\nSamoei Ruto and the Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua on their election. \\n\\nSecondly, I thank the people of Kigumo for giving me this opportunity to serve them \\nas  their  representative  in  this  13th  Parliament.  People  from  Kahumbu,  Muthithi,  Kigumo, \\nKinyona  and  Kangari  Wards,  I  thank  you.  I  promise  you  that  I  do  not  take  for  granted  the \\nelection we conducted and you giving me the votes overwhelmingly. I will endeavour to serve \\nyou. I assure you that I will keep all the promises I made. I also take this opportunity to thank \\nmy family, my dear wife and children for the support they gave me during the campaigns. I \\nthank  my  extended  family  too  and  my  brothers  and  sisters,  and  my  mother  in  Mareira,  for \\ngiving the support that was required during the campaigns, for me to get to this Parliament. I \\nassure them that our family name is in safe hands. \\nI would like to tell the people of Kigumo that we have projects that we are following \\n \\nup. We have Kangari Market that, we know, is halfway done. I assure them that we will be \\nlooking at it and making sure that it is completed. We are launching Muthithi Market. We will \\ndo ground breaking next week. I assure them that we will ensure that all the projects we have \\nin the constituency are completed during my term. I also assure them that we have spoken about \\nbursaries and the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). I thank \\nthe President for mentioning it here and assuring us that we will have the kitty to enable us \\neducate our children. We know that many of them are at home and some of these children can \\nonly be helped by paying their school fees from the kitty. We assure them that we will do that \\nwithout favour, and it will get to the needy people. \\n \\nTo comment on the President’s Speech, one of the things that really touched us as the \\npeople of Kigumo is on agriculture. We come from an agricultural constituency. We have tea \\nand coffee, and we do dairy farming and horticulture. Many of us are touched by farming. So, \\nthe issue of fertiliser subsidy has really helped. That is money directly put into people’s pockets \\nthrough the President’s Order to have the cost of fertiliser reduced. I saw the President meeting \\nwith the Tea Board of Kenya yesterday. I request him that we also look at the market. As we \\nget the farmers, especially of tea, let us do away with the cartels that control the prices. Since \\nhe has decided that we should go with one brand that is Kenyan and stop having blends, I ask \\nhim to look at having a better market for our tea farmers so that we can put more money into \\ntheir pockets. \\n \\nI thank the President too for mentioning the Hustler Fund. We are waiting for the kitty \\nbecause our  young men and women are at home and most of them are jobless. They do not \\nhave  capital  to  start  and  run  their  businesses  to  enable  them  feed  their  children.  He  also \\nmentioned the issue of water. Water is one of our real problems, especially in the lower areas \\nof  our  constituency.  We  would  like  to  be  involved  as  much  as  possible  because  if  we  are \\nincreasing the water supply from 60 per cent to 80 per cent, the constituencies that suffer most \\nshould be at the frontline. The lower area of Kigumo, especially Kahumbu, parts of Muthithi \\nand areas of Kangare need support and water made available.  \\n \\nthat they can start their businesses even in the Jua Kali sector and run them for income. \\n\\nThe President mentioned electricity. We want to  connect our people  to  electricity so \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I will also mention the issue of interest rates, and especially the \\nFuliza issue. We know that many of our people have those loans on their phones. Some of them \\ncannot transact using M-Pesa due to these loans. The lowering of the interest rates is really a \\ngood thing for us. I hope they will be lowered even further because even the 50 per cent is still \\nhigh.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We have the Mau Road that is being constructed \\nand we have had issues with it. This is because it traverses more than one constituency. It would \\nbe fair for the Cabinet Secretary to answer one Question instead of each Member of Parliament \\nasking a Question to the Cabinet Secretary on their own, and them having to prepare an Answer \\nfor each one of us. That should be supported. On any legal framework that will come into this \\nHouse for us to actualise, I assure the President of our support.  \\nI will finish by saying that, coming from an agricultural constituency, we will still need \\n \\nmore to be done for our agriculture. There is market for our Hass avocadoes. We need to be \\nassured  because  we  have  somewhat  of  a  cartel  in  the  avocado  industry.  That  is  so  that \\neverybody sells their avocadoes directly without having to go through brokers hence making \\nmore money. \\n\\nAny legislation that will come into this House aims at supporting and actualising the \\npromises made by the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Government and our President. So \\nlong as it is serving our people, they can count on my support. I also assure our Kigumo people \\nthat their interests of being represented will be well done. On legislative functions, I will make \\nsure that laws passed here also support and favour us. I assure them that we shall oversee the \\nGovernment.  \\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Member for Dagoretti South. \\n \\n \\nHon. John Kiarie (Dagoretti South, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, I take this very early \\nopportunity to, first, congratulate you. You are legendary. You are one of the few Kenyans I \\nknow who have served in all the three Arms of the Government. We saw you do some amazing \\nwork in the Executive. We know you did some great leadership in the Judiciary and you are \\nnow in the legislative Arm of Government as the Deputy Speaker. I take this opportunity on \\nbehalf of the people of Dagoretti South to profusely congratulate you on ascending to the very \\nhigh office of Deputy Speaker of this House. In the same breath, I congratulate the Rt. Hon. \\nMoses Wetang’ula on being elected overwhelming as the Speaker of the 13th Parliament. This \\nis my first address in this House on a substantive issue. So, I take this opportunity to thank the \\npeople of Dagoretti South Constituency, who decided that kweli it is time for us to get back to \\nBunge and do that which we had started in the last term.   \\n\\nOn the speech by the President, I want to concretise it into thematic areas. I was able to \\nnote that the speech by the President was succinct. It was short, sweet and to the point and after \\nall was said and done, out of the many paragraphs, one is able to summarise it into seven very \\nprofound thematic areas. His Excellency, the President was able to speak on agriculture and \\nfood security and the grand plan. He not only spoke about it but he has already sanctioned it \\nthrough  executive  action  because  we  saw  him  moving  our  subsidies  from  consumption  to \\nproduction. On that alone, I commend His Excellency, the President.   \\n\\nThis is a man who was elected on the back of a wave of a campaign that was driven by \\nthe hustlers of this country. The President was careful to recognise that there is a sector called \\nthe  Small  and  Micro  Enterprises  (SMEs)  and  to  it,  he  spoke  elaborately  about  the  plan  of \\ninvesting in this very critical sector. Of importance to me is the fact that this House has a role \\nto play in connecting the drive on SMEs with the Technical and Vocational Education Training \\ninstitutions (TVETs) and the installation of institutions that will be used for incubation and for \\napprenticeship for the people in the SMEs. \\n\\nFor  people  like  us  who  represent  urban  constituencies,  we  took  note  of  the  great \\ninvestment  in  the  Hustler  Fund  and  the  Enterprise  Fund,  which  we  know  is  going  to  spur \\ndevelopment  in  this  area.  I  pride  myself  as  the  “women  representative”  of  the  people  of \\nDagoretti South Constituency. I am a feminist and admittedly so, so I was very excited when \\nHis Excellency the President took up the women agenda. We know what the plans are and we \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   6 \\n\\n \\nsaw  them  when  he  signed  charters  with  the  women  of  this  country.  Not  only  did  he  sign  a \\ncharter but he also transformed it into an agenda in his manifesto, which ended up becoming \\nthe Kenya Kwanza Plan that we shall be implementing. I commit as a feminist and the “women \\nrepresentative” of the people of Dagoretti South to support any legislative agenda that will push \\nthe women agenda in this House. \\n\\nHis  Excellency  the  President  was  keen  to  bring  up  the  health  agenda.  When  each \\nMember of Parliament here does their clinics on Monday mornings, the biggest issue they have \\nto contend with is how to pay hospital bills and bills for the deceased.  This  country cannot \\nafford  to  continue  paying  for  health  out  of  pocket.  When  his  Excellency  the  President  will \\nchampion Bills to reform the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) in this House, I shall \\nbe  a  champion.  I  will  champion  for  the  reform  of  the  health  sector,  and  more  so  health \\nfinancing. I commend the President for putting it in his speech. \\n\\nWe have been told that there is a taskforce coming up to review the Competency Based \\nCurriculum (CBC).  So, when it came up as an agenda on the President’s Speech, I was excited \\nbecause some of us have children in Grade Six this year. We want to know what CBC means \\nfor a young child of 12 years taken to a high school and has to be in school with students who \\nare probably 18 or 19 years. So, when we shall come to the issue of education, I know even \\nthis House shall be involved in recommending some changes to CBC form of education and \\nthis taskforce will be one of the things that will be a highlight in the life of this Parliament.   \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  applied  himself  on  the  issue  of \\nInformation Communication Technology (ICT) and the digital economy.  This is a sector that \\nbrought me up. I would like to report to this House that in the world that we are living today, \\nideas and data are the currency.  If we do not take note of the new and emerging economies in \\nthe digital and creative economy, we shall not be fit for any purpose in a time such as this.  So, \\nit  is  my  joy  and  celebration  that  His  Excellency  the  President,  through  his  very  important \\nspeech, was able to address the issues of the creative digital economy.   \\n\\nThe question on whether telcos should continue operating as banks, whether they can \\nbe regulatable when they operate by the Communications Authority of Kenya while they are \\nalso conducting monetary business that should be overseen and regulated by the Central Bank \\nof Kenya (CBK) is an issue of concern. The issue of Fuliza and digital loans is critical. We \\ncannot have a country that is listed as people who cannot pay loans. The idea of moving the \\nCredit  Reference  Bureau  (CRB)  to  a  credit  system  was  very  welcome  as  an  idea  from  His \\nExcellency the President. I know this House shall have a bite on this issue. I know that our \\nMembers who represent Kenyans and have been listed, and who have been condemned shall \\nbe contributing to it. \\n\\nFor me, the housing issue is critical. I hail from this city that brought me up. I do not \\nknow of any other place. As people retreat to their rural areas, Nairobi is my ushago so to say.  \\nSo, when the issue of housing and settlement was brought up by His Excellency the President, \\nI was keen to know what he had to say. I picked out a great idea of aggregation, specialisation \\nand standardisation that speaks to the people of Dagoretti South, who are worldly renowned as \\nartisans and as Jua Kali Sector idea leaders. Hon. Deputy Speaker, if you drive on your way \\nfrom Adams Arcade round-about all the way to Karen, you shall see the street lined-up on both \\nsides of the road by Jua Kali artisans. These are people who will benefit from the housing and \\nsettlement plan.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because there is no much time to lay out everything I wanted to \\nsay, I would leave it at the issue of corruption.  Hon.  Fatuma Mohammed from Migori County \\nsaid that His Excellency the President had nothing to say about corruption. That speech was \\nladen with issues if addressed would address the main issue of corruption. Even as we address \\ncorruption,  we  need  to  remind  ourselves  what  Mother  Theresa  told  us  –  that,  whatever  you \\nresist, persists. We cannot keep glorifying corruption by giving it a high pedestal. Let us start \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let us make institutions that are titled with the word integrity and let \\nus stop glorifying corruption as a name. The more we glorify it, the more it persists. It is upon \\nus to align ourselves with integrity, ethics and morals but not to keep glorifying corruption. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity. I take this chance to \\ncongratulate each and every Member of Parliament who was elected and I wish you a good… \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you Member for Dagoretti South for your kind words.  \\n\\nI would now call the Member for Suna West.  \\n\\nHon. Peter Masara (Suna West): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving me this \\n\\nopportunity to contribute in this House. \\n\\n First, I congratulate you for being elected the Deputy Speaker of the 13th Parliament. \\nBefore I say something about today’s agenda, let me thank the great people of Suna West for \\nelecting me for the second time to represent them in this very important House.  \\n\\nI thank the  youth,  religious leaders, professionals, business  community and all those \\nwho worked 24 hours to ensure that my second victory is one which I am not taken to court to \\nbe challenged.  \\n\\nAs I continue to contribute to today’s Motion, there are several areas I want to mention, \\nmore  particularly  on  the  youths.  We  are  talking  about  the  Hustler  Fund  according  to  the \\nPresident’s Speech. Some hustlers are old men and women, and the youths. I however want to \\nparticularly put emphasis on the issue of the youths of this country. Many were promised that \\nthere would be pesa mfukoni while some were to be given Kshs6,000 every month. All of them \\nare, however, now lamenting. If you read the Bible, the Book of Habakkuk, they do not know \\nif there is money in their pockets or at the end of the month they are going to get the promised \\nKshs6,000. Can we not formulate a policy to have a youth commission that will ensure that \\nsmall and medium enterprises money is given to the youth? This is because they do not have \\nenterprise startup capital. As we move forward and discuss the President’s Speech, we should \\nalso put emphasis on the issues of youths so that they can be part and parcel of this country.  \\n\\nI agree with what the President said on the Universal Health Coverage. We want to try \\nand  increase  the  number  of  people  being  covered  by  the  National  Hospital  Insurance  Fund \\n(NHIF). However, let us also consider the standards of health facilities in this country. We have \\nvery few referral hospitals in this country. If we do not increase their numbers to enable every \\ncounty to have a well-equipped hospital, we will continue losing our citizens simply because \\nthey cannot access standardized health services. On the same note, we may talk of Universal \\nHealth Coverage but what about the health workers? Do they have good representation? As we \\ntalk,  the  47  counties  are  not  able  to  manage  our  health  workers  well.  This  House  should, \\ntherefore,  consider  forming  a health commission  so that they  can deal  with  issues of health \\nworkers in this country.  \\n\\nOn the same note, I want to talk about infrastructure. The President did not cover this \\nin his Speech. The people of Suna West were expecting a lot in terms of infrastructure. We \\nhave a major road in Suna West called Kababu-Piny Oyie-Adera Road which is still unusable.  \\nWe expected a lot of money to be allocated to infrastructure so that we can benefit to enable us \\nmake this road to bitumen standard.  \\n\\nWe have civil servants in this country and as we all know, the cost of living is so high \\nwhile  salaries  remain  the  same.  We  need  to  look  into  our  civil  servants,  and  our  men  and \\nwomen in uniform when we discuss economy issues. This is because in their circumstances, \\nvery few people think about them.  \\n\\nOur  education  system  is  confusing.  Let  us  formulate  policies  which  can  guarantee \\nstandardized education. Today, even the professionals are not sure of what is going to happen \\ntomorrow. January is just next door but we do not know the system we will use. Above all, the \\nGovernment  has  tried  over  a  period  of  time  on  the  issues  of  free  secondary  education.  The \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Something has to be done about it.  \\n\\nWe also need to do something on the price of unga. Currently, it is trading at Kshs200 \\nplus. School principals are buying maize from the same market but the capitation allocation, \\nwhich was done 10 years ago, still remains constant. Are we doing favour and justice to these \\nschools  and  students  or  we  are  losing  it?  As  legislators,  I  believe  we  can  do  something  to \\nsalvage this country.  \\n\\nI want to talk about the KRA issue that was mentioned world over. I have been doing \\nsome small research world over and there is no friendly tax collector.  A tax collector is always \\none. The best thing that can be done is to come up with good  policies where those who are \\npaying tax can see or feel value for it; and by doing so, nobody will complain about it. We need \\nto see good roads, hospitals and salary increments.  \\n\\nOn the issue of security, what are we doing for our people who are not secured? Are we \\nincreasing the number of vehicles for police officers? Are we increasing the salaries for men \\nand women in uniform? Are we jailing criminals or letting them go scot-free? Our courts should \\ndo something about the people responsible for insecurity in this country.  \\n\\nFinally, I congratulate each and every Member of this 13th Parliament for being elected. \\nI remind them that as we are now being celebrated, we will become the enemies of the public \\nthe  next  day  if  we  do  not  meet  their  expectations.  We  need  to  do  things  which  we  will  be \\nremembered for, whether in this House or out there. We must develop our people to an extent \\nthat even when you are no longer in Parliament, people talk about you. That way, people will \\nremember you many years after you exit the position of leadership.  \\n\\nI thank my ODM party and my leader Hon. Rt. Raila Amollo Odinga for giving me an \\nopportunity to serve the people of Suna West as an elected Member through his party. The last \\ntime I was in this House as an Independent Member of Parliament, I faced so many challenges. \\nI pray that the current Independent Members do not face the same. We need to strengthen our \\nparties  so  that  democracy  can  prevail  in  this  country.  We  need  people  like  Hon.  Rt.  Raila \\nAmollo Odinga to be respected and given opportunity as the few statesmen we have in Africa \\ntoday.  \\n\\nAs we are about to talk about Azimio la Umoja and Kenya Kwanza, we must know that \\nthere are people who contributed to the liberation we are enjoying today. Sometime back, there \\nwere areas which could not develop themselves because there was no devolution. Some people \\ndied because of fighting for devolution. If I recall, someone like Dr. Odhiambo Mbai was killed \\nbecause he was agitating and fighting for the people of Kenya to be liberated for the second \\ntime.  \\n\\nNobody  was mentioned  as a candidate for  the Ministry of Devolution  and Planning. \\nThat worries me because I was the last Mayor of Migori, and I know what devolution can do. \\nSomething, therefore, needs to be done so that we have a powerful Minister to head the Ministry \\nof  Devolution  and  Planning  so  that  we  can  strengthen  our  devolved  units  for  people  to  get \\nservices irrespective of whether they are in or out of Government.  \\n\\nThank you for giving me the opportunity. \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  What  is  your  point  of  order,  Hon.  Member  for  Eldas?  I  am \\n\\nsorry Members; it is not a point of order. You can go ahead and contribute. \\n\\nHon. Adan Keynan (Eldas, JP): Thank you for giving me an opportunity to contribute \\n\\nto this important debate.  \\n\\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you for being among the few lady representatives \\nfor the 13th Parliament. I also congratulate all Members here for having been elected to the 13th \\nParliament.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, an elective position is the most difficult and sometimes the most \\nsought-after job. This is why I welcome my colleagues to the 13th Parliament. Enjoy both the \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I am sure in due course you will realise that there are \\ncertain things that we must not take for granted.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, before I go back to the President’s Speech, I would like to thank \\nthe people of Wajir West. I know we have our able Member Hon. Muliro Farah – Hon. Yusuf \\nFarah – that was my first constituency that showed me the door to politics. I was a Member of \\nParliament twice, elected actually for 10 years then later on I moved to Eldas where I am doing \\nmy fifth term as a representative of the people of Eldas.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I must appreciate that at one time the current Head of State and \\nI  were  classified  as  young  legislators  who  benefitted  from  a  programme  called  The  Young \\nLegislators Programme sponsored by the United States of America (USA) Embassy. We went \\naround  globe-trotting  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  being  newly  elected  young  Members  of \\nParliament. That was in 1998. We went to the USA where we visited over 18 States and that \\nProgramme opened the doors for us.  \\n \\nOne thing that I appreciate and felt very good about this particular speech is respect for \\nthe  separation  of  institutional  roles.  Those  of  us  who  were  there  and  participated  in  the \\nmidwifing  of  the  current  Constitution,  one  of  the  things  that  the  August  2010  Constitution \\nemphasised on is respect for the rule of law.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you are a lawyer with many years of experience.  The opening \\nchapter  in  Article  1  emphasizes  on  representation  and  clearly  spells  out  the  nexus  between \\nrepresentation and sovereignty. That is one Article that all of us must accept and pursue to the \\nletter.  At  times  somebody  will  invoke  Articles  95  and  96  and  say  the  role  of  a  Member  of \\nParliament  (MP)  is  not  clearly  defined.  Unfortunately,  the  Salaries  and  Remuneration \\nCommission (SRC) up to now is yet to accept the role of Members of Parliament. It is not just \\nlimited to representation.  \\n \\nAn MP is an embodiment of everything in the Kenyan society. That is why Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, the best diplomats or economic advisors are found amongst Members of Parliament. \\nKenya  is  a  premier  nation.  One  of  the  things  that  the  President’s  Speech  emphasized  was \\ndevelopment of different sectors: the economic, security, infrastructural and education sectors. \\nAll these require an informed, knowledgeable and persistent Member of Parliament through \\nlegislation  and  oversight.  That  is  why  without  the  National  Government  Constituencies \\nDevelopment Fund (NG-CDF), there would be no representation. I will ask my colleagues here \\nto agree with me that “No NG-CDF, no representation.” This is because without it, there would \\nbe no need of being an MP. In the 1990s, when there was no NG-CDF, MPs were miserable. \\nThe presence of the NG-CDF has given life, human dignity and taste to representation.  \\n \\nWhatever  you do, regardless of the differences in our political  persuasions, the NG-\\nCDF must remain an integral part of our day-to-day activities. That is why I appreciated when \\nHis Excellency the President talked about retention of the NG-CDF. For that to happen, it is \\nup to all of us to pursue it to the letter. Otherwise, dictates from the Treasury mandarins will \\nalways be there and they are loyal to their own interests. For us, our loyalty is to those who \\nbrought us to this House. That is a very important ingredient in your life.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  coming  back  to  Kenya,  just  some  few  days  before  the  final \\nresults were announced, the atmosphere was pregnant with so many rumours and speculations. \\nThe people were speculating on what might happen. There were trivial advices and so many \\nother challenges. However, one thing that we must appreciate is the resilience of the Kenyan \\npeople  and  the  maturity  of  our  democracy.  Kenya  is  not  just  a  country  by  name  but  it  is  a \\npremier republic. Today  in  Ethiopia, an eventful  day is happening because of the  effects  of \\nSafaricom diplomacy which is being felt in the entire Africa. We are going to be very proud of \\nthat event because soon the benefits of Safaricom are going to be felt all over.  \\n \\nEqually,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  Kenya  is  an  economic,  security  and  diplomatic  hub. \\nThese are things we must appreciate as citizens and representatives of the people. The other \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   10 \\n\\n \\nday this country was voted as the best in human resource capital. What we need to benefit from \\nthis  is  our  diaspora  diplomacy.  I  know  very  soon  there  will  be  an  inclusion  of  diaspora \\ndiplomacy as one of the tenets of our foreign policy but before that is domesticated, the diaspora \\ndiplomacy has greatly contributed and improved our economy. That is something that each one \\nof us here as Parliamentarians and part of parliamentary diplomacy must be prepared to engage \\nin. In this era of representation, Parliamentarians are the best diplomats in other jurisdictions \\nand  democracies.  However,  in  the  Kenyan  context,  the  Parliamentarian  is  not  regarded  as \\nsomebody who is well informed. This is because of the basic definitions that other people were \\nnot friendly to Parliament previously and the same was projected to the Members of Parliament. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, there is the issue of drought, which His Excellency the President \\nhas alluded to. However, my colleagues from Northern Kenya must accept that the era of food \\nrelief must come to an end. Instead, we need to pursue water availability and irrigation, revival \\nof  Kenya  Meat  Commission  (KMC)  and  Kenya  Livestock  Marketing  Authority  (KLMA). \\nThese things have died over the years. In 1968, Kenya was a leading beef exporter to the whole \\nworld. Today we get our beef from Botswana. In 1968, Kenya was a leading donor nation. In \\nfact, our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was at par with that of South Korea. Today, South \\nKorea’s GDP is five times that of Kenya and yet they have no known natural resource. These \\nare issues we must deal with and address as citizens of the Republic of Kenya.  \\nFinally,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  we  are  approaching  a  very  difficult  time  because  of \\n \\nserious  rise  in  inflation,  economic  stagnation  and  unemployment.  These  are  issues  we  can \\nsalvage if we put our heads together. We are surrounded by countries that have had serious \\nsecurity  challenges  and  that  is  why  Kenya  remains  a  very  important  component  of  the \\ninternational  community.  That  is  why  I  believe  in  their  own  wisdom,  the  international \\ncommunity decided to elect Kenya as a member of the United Nations Security Council. That \\nis  not  just  a  mere  achievement.  It  is  a  serious  achievement  which  we  must  be  prepared  to \\njealously protect.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  just  the  beginning  of  this  Session.  Eventually,  we  will \\nbegin  to  learn  and  appreciate  each  other.  However,  my  final  word  today  on  this  is  that  as \\nMembers of the 13th Parliament, we are one family. Regardless of our political persuasions, we \\nare one family and outside there, we will be treated as Members of one family. Whatever we \\ndo, let us engage soberly and with dignity while appreciating our roles. There is a time I was \\nthe  youngest  Member  here.  Today,  I  am  among  the  oldest  Members  of  Parliament.  Time \\nchanges.  These  are  realities  that  we  must  expect  and  appreciate;  that  my  contribution  and \\nexperience will add value to you. Also, your coming in will add value to me. Ultimately, we \\nhave the best representation in the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Garissa County. \\n \\n \\nHon. Amina Siyad (Garissa CWR, JP): Thank you Hon. Deputy Speaker. My name is \\nAmina Udgoon, the Woman Representative of Garissa County. First and foremost, I would like \\nto thank the people of Garissa County for voting me in. I am a desert flower, a young lady and \\na humanitarian before I became a politician. Thank you. congratulations for being elected as \\nthe Hon. Deputy Speaker. As a woman, I am proud of you.  \\n\\nAbout the speech of the President, it was short, concise and to the point. It is largely \\npeople-centred  and  it  is  about  Wanjiku.  It  reflected  the  aspirations  of  the  new  President  in \\ncharge of the lives of the ordinary citizens. However, there were notable gaps. A million plus \\ncitizens in more than 23 counties are being affected by drought.

Deputy  Speaker:  Thank  you,  Member  for  Garissa  County  for  being  brief. \\n \\nMembers, I think the reason why we had the Procedural Motion on limitation of debate was to \\nensure that as many Members as possible have an opportunity to speak, particularly those who \\nare making their maiden speeches.  I can see there are people who have already spoken, but \\ntheir names are appearing. Kindly pull out your cards. I have a very good memory, in case you \\nthought I have forgotten. For example, the Member for Emurua Dikirr, I can see your name \\nhere and you have already spoken. Member for Kigumo, also remove your card. I will find out.  \\nI now call the Member for Elgeyo Marakwet County, please, proceed. \\n \\n \\nHon. Caroline Ng’elechei (Elgeyo Marakwet CWR, Independent): Thank you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech. First and foremost, \\nI  thank  God  and  the  people  of  Elgeyo  Marakwet  for  electing  me  to  this  august  House.  My \\njourney here was not easy. I come from Elgeyo Marakwet County, which is the ‘bedroom’ of \\nthe United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party. But the people believed in me and voted for me \\noverwhelmingly, and I thank God for this and appreciate them. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from a county with many challenges, and one sector that \\nis  facing  many  challenges  is  agriculture.  About  100  per  cent  of  the  residents  of  Elgeyo \\nMarakwet  are farmers who either keep domestic  animals,  or grow crops.  The issue that has \\nbeen affecting my people recently is that of fertiliser prices, and I applaud and commend the \\nPresident for talking about subsidising farming inputs. I believe that going forward, the life of \\na farmer will be as rosy as anybody who lives in the city; enjoying what comes from the farm \\nwithout knowing the hustle and bustle that farmers go through. \\n \\nI also want to assure the people of Elgeyo Marakwet that we will handle the issue of \\nbanditry in Kerio Valley. This is because they do not enjoy peace because others have taken \\nthe  law  into  their  hands,  and  walk  around  brandishing  firearms  the  way  they  want.  Going \\nforward, I believe that through this House, I will bring legislation to ensure that we can live \\nlike other people.  \\n \\nIt is about time that the issue of banditry in Kerio Valley was categorised as terrorism.  \\nThis is because a bandit is more than a terrorist. If you can remember in the last year, some \\npeople were killed in Kerio Valley by people with illegal firearms in their hands. The number \\nof those killed was more than those killed by the Al Shabaab in the last five years. So, the Al \\nShabaab and bandits are all in the same category. Through this House, I will ensure that we \\ncategorise bandits as terrorists so that the issue of banditry can come to an end. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The previous Government massacred this exercise at the expense \\nof the benefit to the people. I will ensure those projects are revived, so that they can help the \\npeople to irrigate their farms. \\nAllow  me  to  thank  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kenya  for  remembering  mama \\n \\nmbogas and hustlers. In this country, the gap between the rich and poor is widening day and \\nnight.  This  is  because  the  poor  become  poorer  daily.  However,  through  the  Hustler  Fund,  I \\nbelieve that the people of Elgeyo Marakwet will benefit by using the revolving fund to improve \\ntheir lives. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, since I know there is a queue of so many people who want to \\ngive their maiden speeches, I wish to donate the extra time I have so that even my Member of \\nParliament (MP) for Marakwet West can have a chance to give his maiden speech.  \\nI appreciate and thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, if you come to side-talk me requesting for time \\nto  speak,  you  are  automatically  disqualified.  This  is  because  I  do  not  want  to  give  the \\nimpression that if you side-talk me, then you get an opportunity. So, if you come here, you are \\ndisqualified.  Let us have the Member for Nairobi County. If your card is not working, ask the \\nClerk-at-the-Table or the Serjeant-at-Arms to assist you. Let us have Hon. Passaris. \\nHon. Esther Passaris (Nairobi CWR, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First \\n \\nand foremost, allow me to start by congratulating you for being elected as the Deputy Speaker \\nof  this  august  House.  I  also  want  to  congratulate  our  Speaker,  Hon.  Moses  Wetang’ula  for \\nbeing elected, and every Member of Parliament who has made it back. It is said that we had \\nthe highest number of returnees to this Parliament.  \\n \\nI also want to congratulate my worthy opponent, hon. Millicent Omanga, because we \\nhad  an  amazing  campaign  together.  We  did  not  tread  on  each  other’s  toes.  She  accepted, \\nconceded defeat and congratulated me. I think this is the kind of politics that we want.  \\n \\nI also want to congratulate the country, because it has grown in democracy. We had a \\npeaceful  election  and  there  were  many  people  who  were  hurt  by  this  election;  over  seven \\nmillion  people  but  we  stood  for  the  democracy,  which  is  the  respect  that  we  all  have.  The \\npeople  that  supported  Raila  Amolo  Odinga  and  the  Azimio  fraternity,  and  the  respect  for \\ndemocracy. I want to congratulate Kenyans for the peaceful election. We are a model for the \\nentire world. \\n \\nI also take this opportunity to thank the Nairobi voters; those who voted for me, those \\nwho did not vote for me, and those who did not  show up to vote. We understand that there \\nmight have been a lot of voter apathy, and it is something that we, as leaders, will strive to \\nwork for; and make you understand that voting is an important exercise. A total of 8 million \\npeople did not show up to vote, and that should be a concern to every elected leader.  \\n \\n Now  we  are  here  to  discuss  the  President’s  Speech.  While  we  are  looking  at  the \\nPresident’s Speech, I would like to first congratulate the President for being sworn in as the \\nPresident of this country. In this country after an election, we try to come together. Today as \\nwe sit and discuss the President’s Speech, he talked about and touched on a number of issues. \\nFor me, it is not about whether it was a long a speech or a short one. What I took back is the \\nfact  that  he  wanted  to  ensure  that  we  continue  the  programmes  that  we  had  in  the  12th \\nParliament like housing food security and infrastructure, among others. I believe that kind of \\ncontinuity is important. \\n\\nAs  a  women  representative,  when  I  came  into  office,  I  found  projects  that  my \\npredecessor  had  started  but  had  not  been  completed.  I  continued  with  them.  That  is  very \\nimportant. We recently accompanied the President as he was launching a housing project. That \\nis a project that started in the last administration, where he was the Deputy President. He wants \\nto continue with. I like the fact that he actually spoke to the point that the rental income will be \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Nairobi has a slum in every corner. The \\npeople of Nairobi want better housing. That was part of the four agendas of the Government, \\nand I believe that continuity of programs that are good will be very favourable for this country.  \\nThe area that I have a problem when it comes to food security is our rush for Genetically \\nModified Organisms (GMO). I believe that in the whole world, if you go to Europe right now, \\nthe  priciest  commodities  are  the  ones  that  are  organic.  When  we  start  thinking  of  GMOs,  I \\nbelieve that we should start treading slowly. As much as we want to feed our people, we have \\nto make sure that we understand that, as a country, we do not just want to feed ourselves but to \\nexport our products. We have to think twice and we have to educate our people. With the rising \\ncases of cancer, if we rush to GMOs, we might also end up having a situation where we are \\nincreasing  our  medical  costs  and  we  also  have  Universal  Health  Coverage  (UHC)  as  a  big \\nprogramme for this country. \\n\\nOn the idea of savings, the President said that when you retire, your National Social \\nSecurity Fund (NSSF) contributions will not be sufficient for you in retirement at the rate of \\nKshs200. He talked about Kshs2 and Ksh1 coming from the State. That is very good idea. But \\nat the same time, what we have to realise is that if we do not handle corruption, which is the \\nbig elephant in the room, then we will be faced with the situation where people are saving and \\nthe money is being siphoned out and not invested. I believe that when we save for retirement, \\none of the things that we should offer our citizens is affordable housing. We see a lot of citizens \\nthat have worked very hard, but they can hardly live on the retirement benefits that they get \\nfrom the Government.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to the borrowing that we have in this county, the President touched on \\nreducing the budget by over Kshs300 billion. The excess that we have to borrow every year of \\nKshs900 billion is reduced by Kshs300 billion. That is the good initiative but then, we have to \\nask ourselves where we are going to find that money. I believe that this country loses so much \\nmore than the Kshs300 billion to corruption. So, while we are strengthening our institutions, \\nlike the Judiciary, the Police Service and we are giving them budgets so that they can sustain \\nthemselves, we have to deal with corruption. \\n\\nAn  area  that  I  had  hoped  the  President  would  look  into  is  investment  and  investor \\nconfidence. This country right now makes it very difficult for people to invest and bring money \\ninto the country. You have a situation where if you want to deposit any money, the maximum \\nthat  you  are  allowed  to  deposit  is  USD10,000. Many  Kenyans  have  got  money  outside  this \\ncountry, and they cannot come and bring it. We desperately need that money to come into this \\ncountry. I believe that we should allow some kind of amnesty to bring in the money and remove \\nthe obstacle where you have to deposit only USD10,000, and provide sufficient documentation \\nfor it. The problem is that it is stifling many people who are coming into this country to make \\ninvestments.  I believe that not  every amount of  money that comes into this country of over \\nUSD10,000 could be stolen money. But we are making it very difficult for people to come into \\nthis country to invest because of the red tape that we have.  \\n\\nKenya is a blessed country, but we have a situation right now which is drought. We \\nneed an intervention from the Government. It is sad to see that right now, Kenyans do not have \\nfood. In so many parts of this country, children are dying of malnutrition because their parents \\ncannot afford to give them healthy nutritious food. People are dying because there is no food \\nin the country.  \\n\\nSo, while we talk about the fact that this country does not have enough food, I think the \\nmost  important  thing  that  we  have  to  address  as  a  country  is  also  family  planning.  At  the \\nmoment, we do not have enough family planning in this country. We do not buy commodities. \\nFamily planning is dependent on donors. Every country has to plan its population. In Kenya, \\nwe have failed to plan our population. In the 1960’s, when Tom Mboya was asked by the British \\nBroadcasting Corporation (BBC): “What programmes do you have for your country?” The first \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is really sad to see a \\nnumber of women having children, not because they want children, but because they did not \\nhave access to information on family planning. They did not have access to the commodities. \\nThose women have children and they are condemned to abject poverty. \\n\\n  \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair) \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetang’ula) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nI know we say that we are a Christian country, but I want you to understand that even \\nGod himself was a family planner. He believes in family planning. In the cycle of a woman, \\nthere is a period where she cannot have a child. As a country, we need to plan our population \\nso that we can actually look after our environment and also protect the citizens of this country \\nto be able to prosper.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.  \\nThe Hon. Speaker: Thank you. Member for Kandara, proceed.  \\nHon. Members: Ruling!  \\nHon. Speaker: After the Member for Kandara, you will get what you are asking for. \\nHon.  Alice  Wahome  (Kandara,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I  take  this \\nopportunity to congratulate you on your election by this House as our Speaker. Having said \\nthat,  I  also  congratulate  your  Deputy,  Hon.  Gladys  Shollei,  for  being  elected  as  the  Deputy \\nSpeaker. May I then also go further to congratulate each and every Member of this House for \\na very hard job to ensure that they were elected to this House. I congratulate my colleagues, \\nthe  women  Hon.  Members  who  have  been  elected  from  the  29  constituencies.  Those \\nconstituencies  have  agreed  to  elect  women  MPs.  We  are  29  and  I  recognise  that  we  lost  8 \\nwomen by failure to retain their seats. In the last House, we were 23, and I was the Chairperson \\nof that caucus. We are now 29 women. We hope to retain and get an addition. We appreciate \\nthose constituencies that continue to elect women, and specifically my constituency, Kandara, \\nfor giving me a third honourable term. I will forever remain grateful. It is an unusual situation \\nfor a woman to be elected for three terms. Where I come from, we are still very conservative \\nand,  therefore,  Kandara  Constituency  has  demonstrated  progressive  thinking  and  action \\ntowards political development. Thank you.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  of  the \\nRepublic of Kenya, Dr.  William Samoei Ruto  for seeing it fit to  appoint me as the Cabinet \\nSecretary (CS) for the Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Irrigation, subject to the approval of \\nthis House. The approval is a very important process, and nobody should take this House for \\ngranted. Even though some of us have been appointed, I look forward to appearing before the \\nrelevant committee. Those who have said that they will approve my name, thank you. I will \\ntruly appreciate. \\n\\nLet me make my contribution on the Address by the President. I know that I may not \\nhave much time, if I am approved by this House. I am grateful for this opportunity to contribute \\nto the address by His Excellency. To the new Members who may not know me, my name is \\nAlice Muthoni Wahome, Member for Kandara Constituency. Kandara is in Murang’a County, \\nfor record purposes. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I think it is important to read this Address. I know that we all listened to \\nthe Address by His Excellency the President. One key thread that has come out for me is this: \\nHe spoke about ensuring that he will run a Government that is transparent and accountable. \\nThe role of this House is to hold the Government to account. Therefore, for His Excellency to \\ncome out in his own address to uphold the House, and to continue to urge the House to ensure \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker,  the  President  also  said  that  he  hopes  legislative  proposal  from  his \\nGovernment  will  receive  a  bipartisan  approach  in  a  bipartisan  debate,  noting  that  whatever \\nproposals are brought by the Government are proposals for the good and for the interest of the \\npeople  of  Kenya.  I,  therefore,  think  it  is  important  as  legislators  to  isolate  politics  from \\ndevelopment. We all agree that we can debate, we can disagree as we have done before; we in \\nfact even haggle and push, while noting that as legislators, we have a duty to ensure that the \\nGovernment  delivers  on  the  promises  that  it  has  made.  One  key  issue  is  the  promise  as  a \\ncoalition to  look  at  the economy  from  a bottom  up approach. Therefore,  we expect  that the \\nGovernment will continue to look at projects and programmes that will ensure that it lifts the \\npeople from the bottom upwards, while ensuring that where the economy is hurting most is \\naddressed as soon as possible. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, the address by the President also  speaks to reducing the borrowing in \\nthis country. The President, particularly seems to detest the fact that the country has found itself \\nborrowing to finance recurrent expenditure. No country can be proud if it is borrowing instead \\nof putting money into development, production and industrial development. We are borrowing \\nto meet our recurrent expenditure. I appreciate the fact that it has been picked up very early in \\nthis Government’s term.   \\n\\nI have also looked at something relevant to the portfolio that I have been appointed to, \\nwhich includes, ensuring that there is access to water coverage. Access to water is currently at \\n60  per  cent.  The  Government  hopes  that  we  can  push  it  to  80  per  cent.  We  target  to  raise \\nKshs500 billion shillings, as stated in his Address. I hope that it will be possible to work with \\nthe Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and investors to raise the money. If I am approved by this \\nHouse, my office will remain open to MPs. I will make sure that we continue to work for the \\nbenefit of the people. I know that if the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive \\nis improved and enhanced, and if we ensure that there is a logical prudent reasonable working \\nrelationship, we can make a difference. We can deliver to the people, noting that where we are \\nas a country, nobody is proud of the fact that the country is on its knees literally, and that we \\nall need to work very hard. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I want to finalise by saying that the people of Kandara are fairly anxious. \\nI  know  that  they  expected  a  five-year  term  from  me,  having  elected  me  with  quite  a  good \\nnumber of votes. Since campaigns are ongoing, I am sure I will have an opportunity to seek \\nthe approval of my constituents to be able to move to the next office. I know that they would \\nhave wanted me to serve for another term. I do not take it for granted that they gave me that \\nterm. I will be consulting them. We shall be engaging even before I come to appear before the \\nrelevant committee.  \\n\\nThank you, hon. Members for listening to me. I am here until you get me out of here. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, honourable Member for Kandara. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMESSAGE \\n\\n \\n\\nNOMINATION OF PERSONS FOR APPOINTMENT TO THE CABINET \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Hon.

This  has  been  occasioned  by  the  fact  that  the \\nHouse  Business  Committee  (HBC)  is  yet  to  be  formed,  on  account  of  the  question  of  the \\nleadership of the majority party and the minority party, which I will rule on after this. \\n\\nIt is the HBC which is charged with the responsibility of nominating Members to sit in \\nthe Committee on Appointments, save for the slots reserved for the leadership of the House. \\nHaving resolved the stalemate in a short time to come, we will then move to the next level to \\nprocess these appointments.   \\n\\nSection  8  of  the  Public  Appointments  (Parliamentary  Approval)  Act,  2012  provides \\nthat, unless otherwise provided in law, the committee to which such nomination is referred to \\nshall  consider  the  matter  and  table  a  report  in  the  House  within  28  days.  It  is,  therefore, \\nimperative  that  once  the  Committee  on  Appointments  is  formed,  it  should  immediately \\ncommence the process  of consideration of the nominees to  enable speedy conclusion of the \\nvetting process within the set timelines.  \\n\\nI also direct the Clerk of the National Assembly to take the necessary steps and notify \\nthe nominees and the general public through an advertisement in daily newspapers of national \\ncirculation; and on the parliamentary website, of the time and place of holding the approval \\nhearings. This should be done by Friday, 7th October 2022 following which the Committee on \\nAppointments should commence the approval hearings.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

In  accordance  with  the  law,  the  House  would  be  required  to  consider  the \\nCommittee’s  report  and  make  a  decision  on  the  nominees  within  seven  days  following  the \\ntabling of the report; that is on or before Thursday, 3rd November 2022.  \\n\\nThe House is accordingly guided. \\n\\n(Several Hon. Members stood at the entrance) \\n\\nCan the Members at the back take their seats?  \\nHon. Members, the following is a ruling on a matter that has been contested before the \\nHouse  and  in  correspondence  with  my  Office,  and  that  has  taken  centre-stage  in  the  public \\nmedia on the issue of the leadership of the National Assembly in the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nHere I go. \\n \\n\\nCOMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR \\n\\n \\n\\nCONSIDERED RULING: LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL \\n\\nASSEMBLY IN THE 13TH PARLIAMENT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members, you will recall that during the afternoon sitting of Tuesday, 4th October \\n2022, I informed the House that a question had arisen on the manner of constituting the House \\nBusiness Committee, especially with  regard to  the membership reserved for the leaders and \\nwhips of the majority party and the minority party, respectively. In guiding the House on the \\nbusiness to be transacted before the establishment of the House Business Committee and the \\nmanner in which the business would be moved, I indicated that a question had arisen as to who \\nthe bona fide leader of the majority party in the House is. I proceeded to allow the House to \\naddress me on this matter and gave priority to the designated Party Leaders and Whips of the \\nKenya Kwanza Coalition and the Azimio La Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Political Party.  \\n\\nIn the debate that ensued, Hon. Kimani Ichung’wah tabled various coalition agreements \\nentered into by the constituent parties of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition and deposited with the \\nRegistrar of Political Parties. Hon. Silvanus Osoro also tabled letters relating to the matter, an \\nexcerpt of the minutes of the parliamentary group meeting and a list of attendees of the meeting \\nduring which the Party Leaders were elected. \\n\\nSimilarly, Hon. Opiyo Wandayi tabled a copy of a letter dated 7th September 2022 from \\nthe  Registrar  of  Political  Parties  (RPP)  addressed  to  the  Clerk  of  the  National  Assembly, \\nconveying what the Registrar termed as constituent parties of the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya \\nCoalition Party, the Kenya Kwanza Alliance (KKA), the name of one party not affiliated to \\nany coalition and an indication of parties that had filed constitutional petitions and objections \\nto their membership of the Azimio Coalition. \\n\\nWhile contributing to the debate, Hon. Junet Mohamed also tabled what he claimed to \\nbe the coalition agreement entered into between the constituent parties of the Azimio la Umoja \\n- One Kenya Coalition Party. Several other Members also weighed in on the matter, including \\nMember  for  Garissa  Township,  Hon.  Aden  Duale;  nominated  Member  Hon.  John  Mbadi; \\nMember for Ugenya, Hon. David Ochieng’, Member for Tiaty, Hon. William Kamket; Member \\nfor  Kimilili,  Hon.  Didmus  Barasa;  Member  for  Kathiani,  Hon.  Robert  Mbui;  Member  for \\nAinabkoi, Hon. Samuel Chepkong’a; Member for Embakasi East, Hon. Babu Owino; Member \\nfor Kiharu. Hon. Ndindi Nyoro; nominated Member Hon. Sabina Chege; Member for Kibwezi \\nWest, Hon.

Sarah  Korere;  Member  for  Ganze,  Hon.  Kenneth  Kazungu  Charo  and \\nMember for Alego Usonga, Hon. Samuel Atandi. \\n\\nOther  Members  who  spoke  on  the  matter  include  Member  for  Tinderet,  Hon.  Julius \\nMelly; Member for Kilifi North, Hon. Owen Baya; Member for Kabondo Kasipul, Hon. Eve \\nObara;  Member  for  Kangundo,  Hon.  Fabian  Muli;  Member  for  Dagoretti  South,  Hon,  John \\nKiarie; Member for Embakasi South, Hon. Julius Mawathe; Member for Kiminini, Hon. Bisau \\nKakai;  Member  for  Emuhaya,  Hon.  Omboko  Milemba;  Member  for  Tharaka,  Hon.  George \\nMurugara  and  Member  for  Dagoretti  North,  Hon.  Beatrice  Elachi.  At  the  conclusion  of  the \\ndebate, I reserved my considered ruling for today. There are many other Members who rose on \\npoints of order. I need not mention them. \\n\\nFrom the onset, Hon. Members, permit me to amplify a portion of the contribution made \\nby Hon. John Mbadi, which is key to the resolution of this matter. The Hansard records Hon. \\nMbadi as having said that: \\n\\n“There is no contention over which Members constitute the leadership of both \\nthe  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  and  the  Azimio  la  Umoja  -  One  Kenya  Coalition.  The \\nonly contention that exists (and which formed the basis of the debate that ensued) is \\nover which of the two is the majority.” \\nArticle 108 of the Constitution establishes the offices of party leaders in Parliament and \\noutlines the order of precedence to be observed in the National Assembly. The Article provides \\nas follows: \\n\\n108. \\n\\n(1) There shall be a leader of the majority party and a leader of the minority \\nparty. \\n(2) The leader of the majority party shall be the person who is the leader in \\nthe National Assembly of the largest party or coalition of parties. \\n(3) The leader of the minority party shall be the person who is the leader in \\nthe National Assembly of the second largest party or coalition of parties. \\n(4)  The  following  order  of  precedence  shall  be  observed  in  the  National \\nAssembly— \\n\\n(a) the Speaker of the National Assembly; \\n(b) the leader of the majority party; and, \\n(c) the leader of the minority party. \\n\\nHon. Members, what is clear from the Constitution is that the Leader of the Majority \\nParty must lead either a party or a coalition of parties in the National Assembly. I invite the \\nHouse  to  note  my  emphasis  on  the  word  ‘either’.  Article  92  of  the  Constitution  mandates \\nParliament to enact legislation on various aspects of political parties. To this end, the Political \\nParties Act, 2011 was enacted. This law has been amended several times, including as late as \\nFebruary  this  year.  You  will  note  that  section  2  of  the  Act  defines  a  political  party  as  an \\nassociation of citizens, with an identifiable ideology or programme, constituted for the purpose \\nof influencing public policy or nominating candidates to contest elections. The term is further \\ndefined to include a coalition political party. Under the same section, a coalition is defined as \\nan alliance of two or more political parties formed for the purpose of pursuing a common goal \\nand is governed by a written agreement that is deposited with the Registrar. On the other hand, \\na coalition political party is defined as a coalition that is registered by the Registrar as a political \\nparty.  Interestingly,  section  10(1)  of  the  Act  allows  two  or  more  political  parties  to  form  a \\ncoalition or a coalition political party before or after an election, on condition that they deposit \\na coalition agreement with the Registrar. \\n\\nWhat I discern from this definition in section 10(1) of the Act is that Parliament in its \\nwisdom  legislated  as  follows:  That  two  or  more  political  parties  may  form  a  coalition  or  a \\ncoalition party and deposit a written agreement with the Registrar. Further, that a coalition of \\ntwo or more parties may register itself as a political party with the Registrar under the Act.

Junet Mohamed, he submitted names of leaders representing the Azimio la Umoja - One \\nKenya  Coalition  Party.  Curiously,  in  the  same  letter,  the  Member  signed  off  as  Secretary-\\nGeneral of the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition. This begs the question whether Azimio \\nla Umoja One Kenya Coalition is a coalition, a political party or both. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn the debate on this matter, several Members argued that a coalition political party is \\na perfectly legal vehicle that was used in the just-concluded elections to allow individual and \\ncorporate  membership  within  a  coalition.  In  my  understanding  of  Sections  2  and  10  of  the \\nPolitical  Parties  Act,  Parliament  permitted  a  coalition  political  party  to  elect  to  assume  the \\ncharacter of either a party or a coalition. In the last general election, it is evident that Azimio \\nla Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party elected to behave as several political parties in certain \\ncategories of elections and as one political party with regard to the presidential election. It is \\nwithout doubt that if it were to be considered as a political party, Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya \\nCoalition Party has no elected Member in this House today, as no Member was elected under \\nits banner. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nThis is easily discernible from Gazette Notice No.9950 and Gazette Notice No.9951 of \\n2022, both dated 23rd August 2022, and Gazette Notice No.10535 dated 5th September 2022, \\nin which the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declared the persons \\nduly  elected  as  Members  of  this  House  and  their  respective  political  parties.  Further,  it  is \\nnotable that with  respect to  Members nominated to  this House, the Azimio la Umoja  - One \\nKenya Coalition Party elected to nominate Members under the names of its constituent parties. \\nThis can be seen in Gazette Notice No.10537 of 2022 dated 7th September 2022 and Gazette \\nNotice  No.10710  of  2022  dated  9th  September  2022.  The  Azimio  la  Umoja-One  Kenya \\nCoalition  Party  seems  to  have  elected  to  enter  this  House  in  both  elective  and  nominative \\npositions through its individual constituent parties. It is a clear demonstration of the Coalition \\nParty’s  respect  for  freedom  of  association  under  Article  36  of  the  Constitution;  exercise  of \\npolitical rights under Article 38 of the Constitution and freedom of speech and debate in the \\nHouse under Article 117 of the Constitution.   \\nHon.  Members,  Article  108  of  the  Constitution  also  allows  a  coalition  to  elect  and \\n \\ndesignate their choice of the Leader of the Majority Party. The claim by the Kenya Kwanza \\nCoalition  is  based  under  this  limb.  Similarly,  the  Azimio  La  Umoja-One  Kenya  Coalition \\nPolitical  Party has staked its claim  to  the leadership  of the Majority  Party  in exercise of its \\nsecond skin as a coalition. \\n \\nWhat is clear from the Constitution is that the Leader of the Majority Party must lead \\neither a party or coalition of parties in the National Assembly, and not both. Indeed, as I noted \\nearlier  in  this  Communication,  in  determining  the  matter  confronting  the  House  today,  one \\nmust ask the question whether the entities claiming the leadership of the Majority Party are \\nparties or coalitions. The provision of the Constitution seems not to envisage the position of \\nthe Leader of the Majority Party being claimed by an entity that is both a party and a coalition \\nof parties. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The issue that arises at this stage is whether this conduct is in \\nconformity with the expectation of Article 108 of the Constitution, which requires an entity to \\nelect one of the two choices. \\nYou will recall that before the sine die adjournment of the 12th Parliament, the Standing \\n \\nOrders were amended to insert a new Standing Order 2B. This provision requires the Clerk of \\nthe  National  Assembly  to  obtain  a  certified  copy  of  any  coalition  agreement  entered  into \\nbetween two or more political parties. This amendment was necessitated by a dispute that arose \\nat the beginning of the 12th Parliament on the entitlement of the constituent parties of the then \\nNational  Super Alliance  Coalition, which is  commonly  referred to  as NASA Coalition, to a \\nshare in the membership of the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). It was not possible \\nfor  the  then  Speaker  to  resolve  the  issue  without  access  to,  and  perusal  of  the  then  NASA \\nCoalition’s agreement that was deposited with the Registrar.  \\n \\nApart from resolving any disputes related to the membership of the PSC, it will interest \\nMembers to note that pursuant to Article 215(2) of the Constitution, part of the membership of \\nthe Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) is also drawn from nominees of the Majority \\nParty and Minority Parties in the House. This is the basis upon which the Standing Order was \\nintroduced in the last Parliament, so as to enable the Speaker to discern the undertakings made \\nby the parties with regard to the positions available to the House: the sharing of nominees for \\nappointment to Commissions such as the PSC and CRA, entitlement to positions in the East \\nAfrica Legislative Assembly (EALA) and, where necessary, determining the relative majorities \\nin the House. Journals of the House indicate that this provision was hardly intended to be used \\nto resolve questions of which party or coalition of parties has sufficient numbers in this House, \\nso as to be entitled to elect the Leader of the Majority Party.  \\n \\nHon. Members, the Political Parties Act provides a general framework for the formation \\nof coalitions, but leaves the substantive provisions to the formulation of the respective parties \\nto  a  coalition.  Where  the  substantive  provisions  of  a  coalition  agreement  are  unclear, \\nambiguous or are in contention, the interpretation of the intent of the parties is left to the general \\njurisdiction of the legal system. Nevertheless, perusal of an agreement entered into between the \\npartners  in  a  coalition  would  greatly  assist  in  resolving  or  forestalling  unnecessary  disputes \\nwhich are likely to impede the conduct of the business of the House. Indeed, upon obtaining a \\ncopy of the NASA Coalition Agreement, my immediate predecessor urged that the provision \\nof coalition agreements to the House should become standard practice. This is what informed \\nthe introduction of the new Standing Order 2B in our rules of procedure. \\nWith regard to the coalition agreements affecting the affairs of the 13th Parliament, the \\n \\nClerk wrote to the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties on 2nd September 2022. In her \\nletter  titled,  “Requests  for  Information  and  Copies  of  Coalition  Agreements  Pursuant  to  the \\nNational Assembly Standing Order 2B”, she provided the Registrar with a list of parties with \\nrepresentation in the House at the time. The Clerk sought the following from the Registrar:  \\n \\narrangements. Please include the date of the registration of the coalition(s); \\n \\nare in place and the dates of the changes, if any; and, \\n \\nlisted herein. \\nHon. Members, in response, the Registrar noted that as at 21st  April 2022, Azimio La \\n \\nUmoja-One Kenya Coalition Party comprised 26 political parties namely: Jubilee Party (JP), \\nOrange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement of Kenya (WDM-K), \\n\\n(ii) Information on changes made to any of the coalition agreements or partnerships that \\n\\n(i) Guidance on which particular political parties (from the list above) are in Coalition \\n\\n(iii) Certified copies of the coalition arrangements entered into by any of the parties \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

These are the members of the Coalition as at 3rd June 2022.  \\n\\nCan the Members take their seats? \\n \\n\\n(Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members, the letter further notes that the Democratic Party, the National Agenda \\nParty of Kenya, the Grand Dream Development Party and Chama Cha Mashinani effectively \\nbecame members of the Coalition on 5th September 2022. The Registrar of Political Parties also \\nobserved that the National Ordinary People Empowerment Union (NOPEU) is not a member \\nof any of the coalitions. In the letter, the Registrar of Political  Parties also  conveys that the \\nMaendeleo  Chap  Chap  Party  (MCCM),  the  Pamoja  African  Alliance  (PAA),  the  United \\nDemocratic Movement (UDM) and the Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) have \\nfiled constitutional petitions and/or objections with regard to their membership of the Azimio \\nCoalition. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nIt is notable that despite written requests by the Clerk of the National Assembly, the Registrar \\nof Political Parties did not convey certified copies of any pre-election or post-election coalition \\nagreements entered into by the parties with representation in this House in the response to the \\nletter dated 7th September 2022.  \\n\\nMay  I  at  this juncture report to  the House that surprisingly the Registrar of Political \\nParties today morning, at 8.30 a.m. submitted to me, through the Office of the Clerk, documents \\nsaid to be certified copies of the coalition agreements for the Kenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition \\nand the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party. Curiously, whereas the Registrar’s letter \\nto the Clerk of the National Assembly is dated 3rd October 2022, the accompanying agreements \\nbear  a  certification  of  the  following  day,  which  is 4th October  2022.  The  letter  and  the \\ndocuments  were  delivered  to  the  Office  of  the  Clerk today,  6th October  2022.  That  is  more \\nthan six weeks after the request by the Clerk. Seemingly, this may be read by any reasonable \\nperson to be a reaction to the proceedings of the House on Tuesday, 4th October 2022. \\n\\nNevertheless, I have had occasion to peruse the documents accompanying the letter as \\nagainst the documents tabled in the House on Tuesday this week. Despite attempting to advise \\nthe House on the status of the coalition agreements affecting the composition of the House as \\nat 3rd October 2022, the Registrar has again failed to mention the existence of any post-election \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   23 \\n\\n \\ncoalition  agreements.  This  is  a  glaring  omission  when  viewed  against  the  post-election \\ncoalition agreements tabled by the Member for Kikuyu Constituency during the proceedings. \\nThe post-election coalition agreements are critical to the Speaker for purposes of guaranteeing \\nconstitutional  rights  and  political  freedoms  of  Members  of  this  House  elected  under  UDM, \\nPAA, MCCP and MDG. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nThis  now  brings  me  to  the  submissions  made  by  Hon.  Opiyo  Wandayi  on  the \\nsignificance to be attached to the response of the Registrar of Political Parties, which he also \\ntabled  in  the  House  on  Tuesday  this  week  and  any  subsequent  communication  from  the \\nRegistrar.   It  will  be  recalled  that  the  distinguished  Member  for  Ugunja  submitted  that the \\nSpeaker  has  no  other  role  apart  from  conveying  information  contained  in  the  letter  by  the \\nRegistrar to the House. You will agree with me that this view is untenable for two main reasons. \\n Firstly, Section 10 of the Political Parties Act 2011 is clear that coalitions are not cast \\nin stone. They are evolving arrangements that can occur both prior to and after an election. The \\nRegistrar  has  shied  away  from  making  a  determination  on  the  post-election  status  of  the \\nexisting coalitions in light of the submissions made by part of the membership of this House \\nand  letters  written  to  me  by  a  number  of  Members  relating  to  post-election  coalitions.  The \\nSpeaker ought not to be a conduit for this indecision in so far as it has the potential of curtailing \\nthe business of the House that is an important constitutional arm of the national Government. \\nSecondly, you will also agree with me that the assertion by the Hon. Member for Ugunja is \\nflawed  on  account  of  the  history  I  have  given  to  the  House  relating  to  the  rationale  of \\nintroducing  Standing  Order  2B.  It  is,  indeed,  an  established  parliamentary  practice  that  the \\nSpeaker is not a mere conveyor belt of information. The Speaker must apply his mind to any \\ncommunication  or  document  before  it  is  presented  to  the  House  or  admitted  for  use  in  the \\nHouse. This  is  important in  order to  comply  with  the Standing  Orders of  this House and to \\nprotect the dignity of the House. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nIn  the  present  instance,  Standing  Order  2B  expressly  requires  the  Clerk  to  obtain  a \\ncertified  copy  of  any  coalition  agreement  to  assist  the  Speaker  to  ascertain  the  relative \\nmajorities of the House and facilitate transaction business of the House. Certification of the \\ndocument and determination of its veracity and admissibility is of prime importance. You will \\nagree with me again that there would be chaos in this House if I made rulings on the basis of \\nan  unauthenticated,  unverifiable  and  inadmissible  document  that  affects  the  rights  of \\nMembers.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI note that unless the Political Parties Act is amended or the House exercises its power \\nto  call  for  evidence  under  Article  125  of  the  Constitution, there  currently  exists  no  express \\nstatutory  obligation  to  the Registrar  to  furnish  the  House  with  coalition  agreements  as \\ncontemplated  under  Standing  Order  2B.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  12th Parliament  noted  this \\nparticular  gap  and  proposed  amendments  to  the  Political  Parties  Act  whose  introduction  I \\napproved in my Communication issued during the Afternoon Sitting of Tuesday, 4th October \\n2022. Those Members of Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) have a job to do to cure \\nthis lacuna. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

You will recall that I ruled the documents \\ntabled by Hon. Junet Mohamed as inadmissible owing to the inconsistencies that were apparent \\non  the  face  of  the  document.  The  inconsistencies  were  glaring,  especially  in  light  of  the \\nallegations made by Hon. David Ochieng denouncing association of both himself and his party \\nwith  the  Azimio  Coalition  Political  Party.  Apart  from  being  a  Member  of  this  House,  Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng is also the party leader of the MDG, an alleged party in the document tabled by \\nHon. Junet Mohamed. \\n\\nIn light of the objections raised by Hon. David Ochieng, the document became a centre \\nof particular focus with respect to its legality, validity and admissibility. The attempt by the \\nRegistrar  of  Political  Parties  to  convey  what  is  said  to  be  a  certified  copy  of  the  document \\ntabled  by  Hon.  Junet  Mohamed  on  6th October  2022  has  not  made  things  any  better.  The \\ndocument from the Registrar, just like the document tabled by Hon. Junet Mohamed, has the \\nsame glaring gaps and inconsistencies that make it inadmissible. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nMy predecessors have severally addressed the question of admissibility of Papers laid \\nin  this  House.  In  the  most  recent  case,  Hon.  Justin  Muturi  distilled  previous  guidance  on \\nadmissibility  of  documents  into  nine  brief  rules  in  a  Communication  issued  on  Tuesday, \\n10th May 2022 while ruling on the tabling of Papers by the then Member for Wajir County, \\nHon.  Fatuma  Gedi.  The  then  Speaker  ruled  that  in  assessing  the  admissibility  and/or \\nauthenticity or otherwise of a document tabled in the House, the Speaker  ought  to  examine \\nwhether the document:  \\n\\n(i) \\n(ii) \\n\\nrelates to the matter for which it has been tabled; \\nis signed, and if it is a Government document, by the authorised person or \\npersons; \\n\\n(iii)  bears the emblem or logo of the institution/person from which it originated \\n\\nor coat of arms in the case of documents from Government agencies; \\n\\n(iv)  clearly indicates the author and person to whom it is addressed; \\n(v)  discloses the origin or source of the document; \\n(vi)  bears certification where a document other than the original is being tabled; \\n(vii)  if electronic, has been obtained from a source that does not permit alteration \\n\\nof contents; \\n\\n(viii) is related to a claim made before the House or a Committee or its content \\n\\nhas a nexus with the claim; and \\nis stamped and clearly indicates the person signing off the stamp. \\n\\n(ix) \\n\\nCan the Hon. Members take their seats? \\n\\n(Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nHon.  Members,  a  perusal  of  the  document  tabled  by  Hon.  Junet  Mohamed  and  the \\nversion conveyed by the Registrar of Political Parties reveals glaring inconsistencies in both \\ndocuments. With regard to signatures, there is no uniformity in the manner in which the various \\npages of the documents have been signed off, or initialed. Some pages in the documents contain \\nfewer signatures than others while Page 3 of both documents, in particular, contain signatures \\nthat are hardly visible. The pagination of the two documents is also inconsistent. Pages 1 to 22 \\nbear page numbers; several pages with signatures bear no page numbers; and a paginated page \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  am  inclined  to  think  that  these  are \\nsuperimpositions.  \\n\\nHon.  Members,  may  I  at  this  point  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  House  that  several \\nMembers said to belong to the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party have formally \\nwritten to my office to denounce their association with the party. In a letter dated 9th September \\n2022  and  received  by  my  office  on  22nd  September  2022,  the  Member  for  Ugenya \\nConstituency,  Hon.  David  Ochieng  wrote  to  convey  the  decision  of  his  party,  the  MDG  to \\nterminate its membership with the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party. In the letter, \\nHon. Ochieng also notes that his party is now a member of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nIn letters received by my office on 21st and 22nd September 2022, Hon. Kenneth Charo, Hon. \\nGonzi  Rai  and Hon. Anthony Kenga, who were  all elected to  Parliament on the PAA Party \\nticket  formally  distanced  themselves  and  their  party  from  any  association  with  the  Azimio \\nCoalition.  The  three  categorically  noted  that  their  party  should  only  be  associated  with  the \\nKenya Kwanza Coalition with which it has entered into its only existing coalition agreement.  \\n \\n\\n \\nAdditionally, in a letter dated 16th September 2022 and received by my office on 19th September \\n2022, all the seven Members of Parliament elected to the National Assembly under the United \\nDemocratic  Movement  (UDM),  namely  Hon.  Maj  (Rtd).  Bashir  Abdullahi,  Hon.  Hassan \\nKulow, Hon. Haro Abdul Ebrahim, Hon. Mangale Chiforomodo, Hon. Yusuf Adan Haji, Hon. \\nJoseph Lekuton, Hon. Umul Kheir Kassim and Hon. Sulekha Harun distanced themselves and \\ntheir party from any alleged coalition agreement with the Azimio Coalition.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nInstead, they note in their letter that they are party to a post-election coalition agreement with \\nthe Kenya Kwanza Coalition. It is their contention that their affiliation with the Kenya Kwanza \\nCoalition has seemingly been ignored by the Registrar of Political Parties.  \\n\\nIt  will  be  recalled  that  during  the  debate  on  this  matter  on  Tuesday  this  week,  Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng; Hon. Kassait Kamket; Hon. Mwengi Mutuse; Hon. Bashir Abdullahi and Hon. \\nKenneth Charo also raised serious concerns as to the membership of the MDG; KANU; MCCP; \\nUDM and PAA in the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party. At this stage, the question \\nthat comes to my mind as your Speaker is, what am I meant to do with these contentions?  \\n\\nAllegations were also made by a number of Members on alleged coercion and duress \\n\\nwhile entering into agreements with one of the coalitions.  \\n \\n\\n \\nOrder, Hon. Members! I have not finished what I am saying.  \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThis, if true, is a serious affront to the democratic rights and freedoms that we enjoy as \\ncitizens of this country. As a seasoned lawmaker and a lawyer, I note that the political freedoms \\ngranted to Kenyans by the Bill of Rights must be taken very seriously in the affairs of political \\nparties.  If  I were to  rely on the coalition agreements  tabled before this House,  I would find \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Our \\nConstitution is very Rights-centric. In any ruling I make as your Speaker, I must be guided by \\nthe  provisions  of  Article  3;  Article  10  and  Article  21  of  the  Constitution.  These  provisions \\nrequire me to uphold, respect and defend the Constitution whenever applying myself on any \\nquestions brought before me. I am also under an obligation to jealously protect the rights and \\nfreedoms guaranteed by the Constitution to all Members of this House and indeed all Kenyans. \\nYou  will  note that  even when  making  laws,  all  of  you  are  enjoined  under  Article  24  of  the \\nConstitution to ensure that any limits you place on a right or freedom are expressly stated and \\nthat the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society.  \\n\\nHaving  looked  at  the  drafting  style  of  the  Political  Parties  Act,  vis-à-vis  the \\nrequirements of Article 24(2) of the Constitution, it is evident that the Political Parties Act does \\nnot manifest or declare any intent whatsoever to limit the rights guaranteed under Article 36 of \\nthe Constitution on the freedom of association and Article 38 of the Constitution on political \\nrights. Political rights are not absolute. They may be limited in a manner that is consistent with \\nthe  provisions  of  Article  24  of  the  Constitution.  Indeed,  the  Political  Parties  Act  does  not \\nengage in  the substantive limitation  of rights  but only deals  with  the procedural  exercise of \\nthose rights in terms of timelines. Indeed, the architecture of the Act is that timelines are only \\nprescribed with respect to activities that fall before the election date which seem to be related \\nto  the  management  of  the  election  calendar.  There  are  no  timelines  prescribed  for  activities \\nafter the election date. From the provisions of the Act, it appears that a person is at liberty to \\njoin and leave political parties as long as they notify the Registrar of their actions.  \\n\\nI am not sure whether a provision of a coalition agreement regulating the period within \\nwhich a Member may exit a coalition would pass the test of being compliant with the Political \\nParties Act, in the first instance, or the Constitution, in the second instance.  Fortunately, that \\nis not for me to decide. I trust those who are aggrieved will find their way to courts of law in \\nexercise of their powers under Article 165 of the Constitution. Noting that some of the matters \\nraised were said to be pending either in the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal or the court, I \\nshall refrain from pronouncing myself on such. \\n\\nHon. Members, let me now turn to the nexus between the letter from the Registrar of \\nPolitical  Parties  and  the  several  gazette  notices  published  by  the  Independent  Electoral  and \\nBoundaries Commission (IEBC) with respect to your election or nomination as Members of \\nthis House. Based on Gazette Notices No. 9950 and 9951 of 2022 both dated 23rd August 2022; \\nGazette Notice No. 10535 of 2022 dated 5th September 2022; Gazette  Notice No. 10537 of \\n2022 dated 7th September 2022 and Gazette Notice No. 10710 of 2022 dated 9th September \\n2022  the  current  composition  of  the  National  Assembly  by  individual  political  parties  is  as \\nfollows: The UDA), 145; ODM, 86; Jubilee Party, 28; WDM, 26; UDM, 8; ANC, 8; FORD-\\nK, 6; KANU, 6; DAP-K, 5; PAA, 3; KUP, 3; UPIA 2; MCCP, 2; TSP, 2; UPA, 1; NAP-K, 1; \\nNOPEU, 1; GDDP, 1; DP, 1; MDG)1; and CCM, 1. \\n\\nHon. Members, reference to the letter by the Registrar of Political Parties would give \\nthe cumulative number of members of the constituent parties of what the Registrar refers to \\nas the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party as 171 Members against 165 Members \\nof the constituent parties of what the Registrar refers to as the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. It is \\nhowever,  notable  that  a  total  of  14  Members  are  drawn  from  four  parties  which  is  UDM, \\nMDG, MCCP and PAA who according to the letter of the Registrar have filed constitutional \\npetitions and objections against their membership in Azimio. This implies that the letter from \\nthe Registrar may not be used to compute the membership of the Majority and Minority parties \\nby dint of the admission contained in it on the existing constitutional petitions and objections. \\nHon. Members, it will also be recalled that the Members of UDM, MDG, MCCP and \\nPAA have claimed they signed pre-election and post-election coalition agreements with the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition. Cumulatively, the membership of the four parties in this \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If these Members were to be added to the 165 Members of the initial \\nconstituent parties of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition, it would comprise a total of 179 Members. \\n\\n \\n\\nConsequently, the Azimio Coalition would then… \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\nI have not finished this ruling at all. Order, Members. If you listen… \\n \\n\\n \\nHon. Mbadi, I am sure you know the difference between if and when. Consequently, \\nthe Azimio Coalition would then comprise a total of 157 Members. However, the pending \\nconstitutional cases and objections by Members of UDM, MDG, MCCP and PAA noted by \\nthe  Registrar  of  Political  Parties,  in  addition  to  the  letters  sent  by  the  Members  and  the \\ncontentions recorded during Tuesday’s Sitting have a profound bearing on the matter at hand \\nin so far as the same relates to the business of the House. \\n\\nAt  this  stage,  the  House  has  a  choice  to  either  halt  its  proceedings  and  await  the \\ndetermination of matters that are before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal and the courts \\nor to permit the Speaker to make a decision that facilitates this House to continue discharging \\nits constitutional functions. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOrder! You will hear the Speaker in silence. In any event, Members are aware that the \\nsub judice rule is a rule that the House imposes on itself. It can never be contemplated that \\nthe House can curtail the performance of its own mandate.  \\n \\n\\nCan the Hon. Members at the Bar take their seats?  \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n (Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\nHon. Member, take your seats. This includes among others, the formation of not only \\nthe  House  Business  Committee,  but  also  other  key  Committees  of  the  House  whose \\nmembership must be appointed within a prescribed timeline of seven days and others that are \\nextremely critical to the functioning of this House and the national Government. \\n\\nThe Committees that ought to be constituted within seven days include the following: \\n1.  The House Business Committee which determines, prioritises and approves \\n\\nthe business to be considered by this House under Standing Order No.171; \\n\\n2.  The Committee on Selection which is responsible for nominating Members \\n\\nto serve in Committees under Standing Order 172; \\n\\n3.  The Committee on Appointments which is responsible for vetting of persons \\nnominated  to  serve  as  Cabinet  Secretaries  under  Article  152(2)  of  the \\nConstitution; \\n\\n4.  The  Budget  and  Appropriations  Committee  which  is  responsible  for \\n\\nconsideration of the Budget Estimates; and \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  National  Government  Constituencies  Development  Fund  Committee \\nwhich  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  policy  and  legislative  framework \\nmatters relating to the NG-CDF. This is especially important noting the need \\nfor a forum to deliberate some current matters that you are all fully aware of. \\nHon. Members, the disclosure by the Registrar relating to the petitions and objections, \\nthe letters by the Members of the four parties, the oral objections raised in this House, and the \\nneed to promote the continuity of the business of the House while respecting the due process \\nof  the  courts  of  law,  presents  this  House  with  a  complex  situation  that  requires  balanced \\nconsideration of the intent and philosophy behind the provisions of Articles 108 and 124 of the \\nConstitution. \\n\\n In  determining  this  delicate  balance  between  the  provision  that  establishes  the \\nleadership positions of the House, and the provision which empowers this House to make its \\nown rules of procedure, due regard must be given to Article 3 of the Constitution which requires \\nall persons to protect, defend and uphold the Constitution and Article 10 of the Constitution \\nwhich requires one to apply the national values and principles of governance when interpreting \\nthe Constitution. \\n\\nHon. Members, I note that the four parties which I mentioned cumulatively, comprise \\nof 14 Members. The Members elected to this House under the four parties have exercised their \\nfreedom of association under Article 36 of the Constitution. They have already migrated to the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance both in writing and in action. The parties are already enjoying benefits \\naccruing  from  their  membership  of  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  based  on  the  coalition \\nagreements that they signed and deposited with the Registrar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n Indeed, and as noted earlier, the 14 Members have written to me distancing themselves and \\ntheir parties from the Azimio Coalition and have called upon Hon. Speaker to recognise their \\ncoalition agreement with Kenya Kwanza with respect to the business of this House. I also noted \\nthe verbal representation made by some of the 14 Members during the debate on this matter on \\nTuesday, 4th October 2022. \\n\\n Hon. Members, I started by noting the sentiments by Hon. John Mbadi on the fact that \\nthe  Members  comprising  the  leadership  of  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  and  the  Azimio  la \\nUmoja-One  Kenya  Coalition  Party  was  not  in  contention.  Indeed,  no  objection  was  raised \\nduring the debate on the issue of either proposing an alternate line up or the allusion to the \\nexistence of any other coalition comprising any parties with representation in this House. \\n\\nHaving addressed the question of who between the Kenya Kwanza Coalition and the \\nAzimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition is entitled to appoint the Leader of the Majority Party, \\nallow me to discharge my responsibilities under Standing Order 19A(4) and 20(4) with respect \\nto the leadership of the House in the 13th Parliament. \\n\\nHon. Members allow me now to address the House on the fate of the letters received \\nfrom Hon. Jeremiah Kioni, the Secretary General of the Jubilee Party, which I mentioned in \\nmy Communication on Tuesday, 4th October, 2022. The Jubilee Party, and indeed, any other \\nparliamentary party is at liberty to designate its party leaders and whips by dint of the provisions \\nof  Standing  Order  20A  which  provides  for  the  recognition  of  parliamentary  parties. \\nSpecifically, the Standing Order provides that a parliamentary party has the right to designate \\na leader and Whip of the party in the House for purposes of the transaction of the business of \\nthe  House.  However,  in  parliamentary  practice,  the  House  frowns  upon  any  purported \\ncommunication emanating from “strangers” especially if the matter relates to the internal \\norganization of sections within the House. This is intended to ensure that the House only \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

For \\nclarity, Standing Order 20A (3) provides, and I quote: \\n\\n3.  The  names  of  the  Members  designated  as  party  whips  shall  be \\n\\ncommunicated to the Speaker in writing by: \\n\\na)  the Leader of the Majority Party on behalf of the Majority Party; \\nb)  the Leader of the Minority Party on behalf of the Minority Party; \\n\\nor \\n\\nc)  the leader of a parliamentary party in the National Assembly in \\ncase of a parliamentary party that is not part of a coalition forming \\nthe Majority Party or the Minority Party.” \\n\\nIn  order  to  facilitate  the  transaction  of  the  business  of  the  House  the  Leader  of  the \\nMajority Party and the Leader of the Minority Party are required to forward to me the names \\nof Members who shall sit in the five critical committees that I mentioned earlier. \\n\\nHon.  Members,  Standing  Order  171(1)(f)  provides  that,  apart  from  the  House \\nleadership, the House Business Committee consists of nine other Members nominated by the \\nparliamentary  parties,  reflecting  the  relative  majorities  and  taking  into  consideration  the \\ninterests of parties other than parliamentary parties and independents. \\n \\nFurthermore, Standing Order 172(1)(c) provides that besides the House leadership, the \\nCommittee on Selection consists of not less than 11 and not more than 21 Members nominated \\nby the parliamentary parties reflecting the relative majorities and taking into consideration the \\ninterests of parties other than parliamentary parties and independents. \\n\\nStanding Order 204(1) provides that apart from the leadership of the House, Committee \\non  Appointments  consists  of  not  more  than  15  other  Members  nominated  by  the  House \\nBusiness Committee on the basis of proportional party membership taking into consideration \\nthe numerical strength of the parties and interests of independents. \\n\\nHon. Members, upon formation of the Committee on Selection, I will be asking the \\nparty  leadership  to  nominate  Members  for  appointment  to  the  rest  of  the  committees  with \\nparticular priority to the Budget and Appropriations Committee and the National Government \\nConstituency Development Fund Committee. It is imperative that in nominating the Members \\nto  the  Committees,  Majority  and  Minority  Leaders  should  as  much  as  possible  take  into \\nconsideration  the  gender  representation,  the  need  for  regional  balance  and  the  interests  of \\nparties other than parliamentary parties and indeed the Independents. \\n\\nAs to the completeness of the membership of the aforementioned committees, you \\nwill note that I have reserved some slots for Independent Members in each of the three \\nCommittees  whose  nomination  ratios  I  have  specified.  This  is  to  ensure  adherence  to  the \\nStanding Orders which require the recognition of the various shades of opinion represented \\nin the House. As my predecessor noted during the 12th Parliament, “the Speaker should protect \\nthe  Independent  Members  and  small  parties  in  the  nomination  to  and  discharge  from \\ncommittees.” \\n\\nHon. Members in summary therefore, my considered determination on the matter \\n\\nraised is as follows: \\n\\n1.  THAT, consideration of the various allegations of coercion and duress at the time \\nof entering into coalition agreements and any appropriate remedy for the same lies \\noutside the authority of this House. \\n\\n2.  THAT, in my considered opinion, it would be imprudent to treat the 14 Members \\nelected to the House under the UDM, PAA, MCCP and MDG as part of a coalition \\nthat  they  have  expressly  distanced  both  themselves  and  their  parties  from.  I  am \\ntherefore persuaded that the 14 Members and their parties are part  of the Kenya \\nKwanza Coalition. This, in my view, would be fair and in accordance with previous \\nrulings by my predecessors on related matters. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Whereas,  of  course,  I  do  not  agree  with  it,  I  would  wish  to \\nacknowledge the fact  that this House operates in  a quasi-judicial manner.  Therefore, in  line \\nwith rules of natural justice, tenets of democracy and established jurisprudence, I would wish \\nto give notice that we shall be moving you to review your decision. For that reason, I will be \\nasking you to give me an opportunity to make certain submissions or to make an application \\nfor  you  to  review  your  decision.  My  application  is,  obviously,  in  line  with  established \\njurisprudential practice. Again, I will be asking you to direct the Clerk to facilitate my coalition \\nwith certified copies of your ruling, if possible by close of business today. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, I say this with tremendous respect to your office and to the institution of \\nParliament.  It  is  important  for  us  to  establish  a  culture  of  openness  and  transparency  and, \\nindeed, to work consciously towards entrenching democracy and the rule of law. So, I will be \\nasking you to allow me to formally make that application at the earliest possible opportunity. I \\nam seeking leave. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. In the tradition of the House, under our Standing \\nOrders and practice, once the Speaker makes a ruling such as the one I have made, it is not \\nsubject to debate, it is not appealable and it stands as it is. I want to take this opportunity to \\nsalute and thank you, Hon. Wandayi and all Members of the House, for the decorum that you \\nhave exhibited throughout the close to one hour that I delivered the ruling. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let the chips fall \\nwhere  they  may.  Take  up  your  offices.  Carry  out  a  robust  and  vibrant  oversight  of  the \\nGovernment and make sure that public resources from taxpayers are put to good use. Audit \\ntheir use vigorously and make sure that you do everything possible within the law to ensure \\nthat we have  a responsible Parliament, with both  sides being responsive to  the needs of the \\npeople of Kenya. \\n\\nThere will be no further debate on this matter. You know the rules. You are all very \\nsenior Members. And the new colleagues who have come in want to learn from you. Do not \\ngive them misdirection on procedure. I now want us to go to the Order that we had suspended \\nto take the ruling. I will give the Floor to Hon. Abdikadir Mohamed of Lagdera.  \\n \\n\\n(Several Members rose in their places) \\n\\nOn the same matter?  \\nHon. Members: Yes. \\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members! Order, Hon. Junet! I have given direction. The \\nruling of the Speaker is a public document; it will be on the parliamentary website. You can \\nget it in the course of the evening or tomorrow, depending on what the Clerks-at-the-Table will \\ndo, and you can analyse it and critique it. You can do many things about it except debate it on \\nthe Floor of this House.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI  indulged  the  distinguished  Member  for  Ugunja,  being  your  leader,  to  make  a \\ncomment, which he did and we have taken it in the stride. I have given him direction and you \\ncan see how distinguished he is with respect to what I have said. I want to urge you to remember \\nthat we have  called out  the order which we suspended before the ruling.  If the Member  for \\nLagdera is on the Floor, he can continue with debate. If he is not, we can give the Floor to the \\nnext Member.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members: He is here. \\nHon. Speaker: Go on, Member. \\nHon. Abdikadir Mohamed (Lagdera, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker.  \\nHon. Members: No! No! \\nHon. Speaker: Member for Lagdera, if you want to cede your time, we can give it to \\nsomebody else. Order, Hon. Members! Order! Order! Order, Hon. Members! The Member for \\nLagdera, you will forfeit your position if you do not want to speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Several Members congregated around the Mace) \\n\\n \\n\\n Order, Hon. Members!

Speaker: Let us have the Leader of the Majority Party.  \\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I beg to move the following \\n\\n \\n \\nMotion: \\n\\nTHAT, pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order No.171(1)(f), this House \\napproves the appointment of the following Members to the House Business Committee \\nin addition to those specified under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)-  \\n\\n1.  Hon. Samwel K. Chepkonga, CBS, M.P.  \\n2.  Hon. (Ms.) Faith Wairimu Gitau, M.P.  \\n3.  Hon. Umul Khier Kassim Sheikh, M.P.  \\n4.  Hon. Omboko Milemba, M.P.  \\n5.  Hon. Robert Mbui, M.P. \\n6.

Speaker, Members will note that in constituting this House Business Committee \\n(HBC),  which  is  slightly  over  a  week  or  almost  two  weeks  late,  we  have  tried  to  achieve \\nregional, ethnic and gender balance and representation in line with our Standing Orders. We \\nhave  considered  small  parties  that  do  not  constitute  parliamentary  political  parties  but  are \\nrepresented  in  the  House.  You  will  note  that  we  have  Members  who  represent  these  small \\nparties from both sides of the political divide. We also have Members from both coalitions that \\nrepresent the main partner-parties. More importantly, you realise that we have a strong team of \\n12  Independent  Members,  and  they  are  also  represented  in  the  House  Business  Committee \\n(HBC) by Hon. Joshua Mbithi Mwalyo.  \\n\\nI  urge  Members  to  support  the  formation  of  this  Committee  because  as  you  are  all \\naware,  we  cannot  transact  any  business  without  the  constitution  of  the  HBC.  This  is  the \\nCommittee  that  will  help  us  to  form  the  Committee  on  Selection  and  the  Committee  on \\nAppointments, and even confirm our Calendar, which without pre-empting debate, is in line \\nfor the course of the day tomorrow. I do not want to say much in relation to this, because all of \\nus know the importance of this Committee. It is regrettable that because of some small issues \\nthat we had in the last week or so, we were not able to constitute this Committee and are late. \\nIn actual fact, we ought to have set up this Committee within seven days. It ought to have come \\non  Thursday  last  week,  but  because  of  the  extraordinary  circumstances,  we  had  to  delay  to \\ntoday. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 2 \\n\\nTherefore, I wish to request Members to support these people. We have endeavoured \\nto pick both new Members who are coming into the House for the first time, and very seasoned \\nMembers  of  the  House,  who  are  very  experienced  in  the  HBC  and  affairs  of  the  House, \\nincluding the House Leadership. I think it is a very well-balanced Committee representing the \\nindependents, the veterans, new Members and even those who represent parties smaller than \\nthe parliamentary political parties that we have. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, with that, I beg for everybody’s support. I ask my brother and colleague, \\n\\nthe Leader of the Minority Party, Hon. Opiyo Wandayi, to second. \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I wish to second the \\nMotion that is before the House on the constitution of the HBC in line with the requirements \\nof  Standing  Order  171.  To  echo  what  Hon.  Kimani  Ichung’wah  has  said,  there  is  no  doubt \\nwhatsoever that Hon. Members who have been placed on this important Committee qualify. In \\nmy view, they are more than equal to the task that lies ahead. This is an extremely important \\nCommittee in the operations of the House. I urge my colleagues to approve the list. \\n\\nOnce the Committee is constituted, I would like it to go out fully and embark on its \\nmandate. One of the biggest tasks that lie ahead is to ensure that business that is prioritised to \\ncome before the House is business that advances the interests of the public. This Committee \\nshould ensure that this House engages in matters that are of importance to the nation. It is on \\nrecord that from as far back as the 11th Parliament, there are reports which have continued to \\nlie on the shelves of this House—reports which should have found their way to the Floor of \\nthis House for deliberation and eventual determination one way or the other by the House. Such \\nreports are still lying idle on the shelves of Parliament. Once constituted, I urge the Committee \\nto take it upon itself to prioritise such business. I will not go into details of those reports. If I \\ndo so, I will be opening a can of worms. Hon. Duale, I am sure you know what I mean by that. \\nThis Committee has its work cut out. I also hope that once this Committee embarks on \\nits work, it will adopt a bipartisan approach to issues and prioritise issues that are of interest to \\nthe country. That is the only way this Parliament can move forward and execute its mandate. \\nCurrently, the country is facing myriad challenges. The cost of basic commodities is getting \\nout  of  reach  for  the  common  man.  Food  prices  specifically  are  out  of  this  world.  That  is \\nsomething that needs to be prioritised by this Committee so that the House can deal with it for \\nthe country to go back to where it should be. The country is facing serious insecurity issues. \\nKenyans are being butchered day in, day out like wild animals. We need to address the issue \\nof insecurity in the country. It is an issue that needs to be prioritised by this Committee. Going \\nforward, we should make it a  rule rather than the exception that whatever  goes through the \\nHBC  and  ends  up  on  the  Floor  of  this  House  is  only  that  which  advances  the  cause  of  the \\ncountry, and not one that advances parochial interests.  \\n\\nThis country is now past the campaign period. We expect everyone in the Legislature \\nand the Executive to get down to work. Everybody should do their work. We expect those in \\nthe Executive to leave campaign hangovers behind them and focus on that which advances the \\ncause of the country. Likewise, this House should now operate beyond the campaigns and deal \\nwith issues that are of utmost importance; issues that unite us rather than those that divide us. \\nThis is a committee that will be very instrumental in those endeavours. \\n\\nWithout saying too much, I second and urge my colleagues to approve the list. \\nThank you.  \\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. Order.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Question proposed) \\n\\nHon. Members: Put the question. \\nHon. Speaker: Is that the mood of the House? \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Members: Yes. \\n\\n(Question put and agreed to) \\n\\n \\n \\nHon. Speaker: Hon. Members, that now brings the House to a level where we can start \\nprocessing and transacting business. I direct that the Members who have been approved by the \\nHouse as Members of this Committee leave the House immediately and go to Committee Room \\n9 for HBC meeting. The Deputy Speaker will continue presiding over the debate at Order No. \\n9, this being the last allotted day of debate on the Presidential speech. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Members. \\nHon. Samwel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi, UDA): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Yes, Hon. Chepkonga. What is your point of order? \\n \\n \\nHon. Samwel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing \\nOrder 259D. As you know, we lost a former Member of Parliament (MP), and I wanted to make \\na statement on his passing on. If you allow me, I would like to read the statement. It would be \\nan honour to do that. \\n \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Go ahead.  \\nOrder, Hon. Members. Let us hear Hon. Chepkonga in silence. \\n\\nDEMISE OF HON. WILLIAM CHEPKUT \\n\\n \\n \\nHon. Samwel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi, UDA): Hon. Speaker, it is with profound sorrow \\nthat I wish to make a statement regarding the untimely passing on of the former Member of \\nParliament MP for Ainabkoi Constituency on the morning of Saturday, 8th October 2022, while \\nbeing  rushed  for  treatment  at  Mediheal  Hospital,  Nairobi.  Hon.  Chepkut  was  born  on  31st \\nDecember 1970. He attended Flax Primary School and various universities before attaining his \\nMaster’s degree from Kenyatta University in Community Development and Organisation. He \\ndeclared his interest to vie for the parliamentary seat of Ainabkoi Constituency in 2017. During \\nnominations,  he  sought  the  seat  under  the  Jubilee  Party  ticket.  He  won  elections  as  an \\nindependent Member of Parliament in the elections that were held in 2017.  \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  for  the  record,  he  defeated  this  Member  who  is  now  reading  the \\n\\nStatement. Nonetheless, as an MP, he sponsored a number of Bills, including: \\n\\n1.  The Coffee Bill (Senate Bill No. 22 of 2020); \\n2.  The Natural Resources Benefit Sharing Bill (Senate Bill No. 25 of 2020); \\n3.  The Health (Amendment) Bill (Senate Bill No. 26 of 2020); \\n4.  The Basic Education (Amendment) Bill (Senate Bill No. 4 of 2021); \\n5.  The Kenya Sign Language Bill (Senate Bill No. 5 of 2011); and,  \\n6.  The County Vocational Education and Training Bill (Senate Bill No. 6 of \\n\\n2021). \\n\\nApart from being an MP, he was also the Vice-Chairman of the Special Funds Accounts \\n\\nCommittee and the Committee on Appointments. \\n\\nHe had a senior position at the Office of the President between 1997 to 2003. He also \\nworked as the long serving personal assistant and private secretary of the Late Hon. Nicholas \\nBiwott, who was a very powerful Minister during the Kenya African National Union (KANU) \\nera. On behalf of the great people of Ainabkoi Constituency and indeed on my behalf, I wish \\nto  convey  our  sincere  condolences  to  his  family,  friends  and  the  people  of  the  larger  Uasin \\nGishu County for this great loss. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker,  with  your  indulgence,  I  request  that  you  allow  that  we  all  stand  to \\nobserve a minute of silence in honour of the late Hon. William Chirchir Chepkut. Fare thee \\nwell, Hon.

Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Yes, Hon. Ng’eno. \\nHon. Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): Hon. Speaker, thank you. With your \\n\\n \\nindulgence, you should allow Members to convey their condolences. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: We have already moved to the next Order. You showed no indication \\n\\nthat you wanted to say anything. \\n\\n \\nHon. Johana Kipyegon (Emurua Dikirr, UDA): Hon. Speaker, I was already on a point \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nof order. \\n\\nHon.  Speaker:  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  will  give  you  15  minutes  to  make  brief \\ncomments.  Remember  that  we  have  a  scheduled  matter  that  should  be  debated  without \\ninterruption.  However,  this  is  an  extraordinary  matter.  I  will  allow  15  minutes  of  three \\nMembers from each side to make comments and eulogise our departed friend. \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon.

On \\n \\nbehalf of the people of Garissa Township and on my behalf, let me send my condolences to the \\nfamily and friends of the former MP for Ainabkoi, the late Hon. Chepkut.  \\n\\nHe was with us in the 12th Parliament, and we will remember him as a very humorous \\nman. I am sure that the person who will miss him most is the former President, Uhuru Kenyatta. \\nThere was no one time that Hon. Chepkut would get an opportunity on the Floor of the House \\nand fail to remember the then Commander-in-Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF). He \\nused  to  call  him  a  five-star  General.  This  man  whom  we  remember  today  has  a  very  long \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

This is another total man. He worked with Hon. Nicholas Biwott for many years. As \\nwe bury him next Tuesday, he will go down with a lot of experience.  \\nHe was a man who could make a call, if you wanted to speak to the late Mzee Moi. He \\n \\nasked me one day whether I wanted to speak to him. I thought that he was joking. He called \\nand in one second, Mzee Moi was on the line. That is how powerful Hon. Chepkut was. I am \\nsure that he is among the many other great leaders whom we have lost in this House. Let me \\nask all Members, in good faith, through Hon. Chepkonga, to contribute. We should attend his \\nburial on Tuesday next week in his remembrance and the people whom he represented. \\n \\n \\nSorry, it is Hon. Chepkut. I apologise.  \\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, those who want to eulogise Hon. Chepkonga… \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe Members who want to eulogise Hon. Chepkut should press the intervention button \\nso that we do not interfere with debate time. We will now have Hon. Kimani Ichung’wah, who \\nis the Leader of the Majority Party. \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Before \\nwe retreat to  attend the HBC, let me also take this opportunity  – on behalf of the people of \\nKikuyu  and  many  other  Kenyans  who  knew  the  Late  Hon.  Chepkut  –  to  convey  our  very \\nheartfelt condolences to his immediate family and the people of Ainabkoi Constituency. \\n\\nAs the ranking Member, Hon. Aden Duale has said that Hon. Chepkut had his usual \\nseat on the front bench here, just right where Hon. (Dr.) Mutunga is seated. We all remember \\nhim  for  his  humour.  Every  time  he  stood  up  to  speak  in  this  Chamber,  he  referred  to  his \\nExcellency the President as the Commander-in-Chief of KDF and a five-star General. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nMany of us found humour in his speech. He was, indeed, a very amiable person with everybody \\nacross the political divide. I do not think that there is anybody who worked with Hon. Chepkut \\nin the last Parliament who would say that he ever stepped on his toes in any way. He was a \\nvery amiable person. He was a likeable character, and a seasoned civil servant who served not \\nonly as a District Officer in the early KANU days, but also as a personal assistant of the late \\nHon. Biwott. \\n\\nWith those few remarks Hon. Deputy Speaker, let us all pray for his family and his soul \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Members,  I  will  give  this  chance  to  the  Member  for \\n\\nto rest in eternal peace. Thank you. \\n \\nMbeere North. \\nHon.  Ruku  GK  (Mbeere  North,  DP):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  for  this \\n \\nopportunity to address the House for the first time. I tried to become the MP for Mbeere North \\nin 2013 and 2017, but failed. So for me, this is a dream come true. I am grateful and humbled \\nby the trust that the people of Mbeere have bestowed upon me. I undertake to serve those who \\nvoted for me and those who did not vote for me in equal measure. I am alive to the functions \\nof the House.  \\n \\nspeech while you should focus on eulogising the Hon. Chepkut. \\n  \\nHouse.

Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member, maybe you can leave the rest of your time and \\ncome back to make your maiden speech hereafter. So, we can now move on to the Member for \\nEmgwen. \\n \\nHon. Josses Lelmengit (Emgwen, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for this \\nopportunity. On behalf of Emgwenians and myself, I pass my message of condolence for the \\nloss of a former Member of this House, Hon. Chepkut. I ask every Member in this House to \\ngive the support the family may need. Let us generously give so that we give Chepkut a decent \\nsend off. \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member for Mwingi Central. \\n \\nHon. Gideon Mulyungi (Mwingi Central, WDM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\n \\nfor  giving  me  this  opportunity  to  eulogise  our  colleague  and  friend,  the  late  Hon.  William \\nChepkut, the former MP for Ainabkoi. \\n\\nI recall the late as a very humorous person. He was the smartest person in this House—\\nalways in a three-piece suit and very humorous. Therefore, on my behalf, my family and the \\npeople of Mwingi Central, I condole the family of the late, and the constituency for the loss of \\nthis humorous and very good person. \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: The Hon. Member for Kimilili. \\n \\n \\nHon. Didmus Barasa (Kimilili, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving \\nme this opportunity to eulogise my friend, the former Member for Ainabkoi Constituency. We \\nwill remember Hon. Chepkut as a very generous man. He was willing to share the little he had \\nwith the disadvantaged. We will also remember him as a hands-on person. This Member would \\ncall even a government officer responsible and put him or her on speaker when there was a \\nmatter affecting his electorate. He was very hands-on. Even with his passing on, we celebrate \\nhis life. There are many things that we must learn from the Hon. Chepkut. May the almighty \\nGod  rest  his  soul  in  eternal  peace  and  continue  to  stand  with  the  people  of  Ainabkoi \\nConstituency. \\n \\n \\nMember for Seme. \\nHon. (Dr) James Nyikal (Seme, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving \\n \\nme an opportunity to eulogise our colleague. On behalf of the people of Seme and myself, I \\ntake this opportunity to pass my sincere condolences to his family and his constituency. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: I think time for eulogies is up. We have four more minutes, \\n\\nThough  hilarious  and  humorous,  this  was  an  extremely  serious  man.  I  know  that \\nbecause we worked with him when I was in the Executive. Behind all that humour, he was a \\nserious, hard working person. I also appreciate that regardless of how tense things were in this \\nHouse  or  how  much  we  differed,  everybody  listened  when  he  took  to  the  Floor.  With  his \\nhumour, he put everybody at peace and, in a way, managed to pass his message. He did this \\nvery diligently and in support and service of the people that elected him.   \\nLet the almighty God rest his soul in eternal peace. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kabuchai. \\n \\n \\nHon. Majimbo Kalasinga (Kabuchai, FORD): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\nallowing  me  to  eulogise  my  good  friend.  I  observed  that  he  never  missed  the  word  ‘sir’  or \\n‘madam,’ throughout his life, whenever he was on phone or addressing anybody. This is a man \\nwho gave respect to anybody he ever called. I join the House in eulogising our good friend who \\nhas left us.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you are not wrong because when you talked of Chepkonga, the \\n\\nname is almost the same with that of the area MP’s.  \\n \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. May God rest his soul in eternal peace. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker: Member for Vihiga County. \\n \\n \\nHon. Adagala Beatrice (Vihiga County, ANC): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I \\ntake this opportunity to pass our condolences, as the people of Vihiga County, to the family of \\nthe late William, who was a Member for Ainabkoi. He used to sit with us here and make us \\nlaugh.  He  was  very  humorous.  Wherever  you  met  him,  he  was  always  laughing.  As  a \\nParliament, we are going to miss his humorous way of talking. He never segregated people. He \\nused to laugh with everybody. We condole with the family and ask God to give them strength \\nat this trying moment as they mourn their departed father, brother and uncle.  \\n\\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  We  can  now  revert  to  the  Motion  on  the  remarks  on  the \\nPresident’s  speech.  We  will  pick  from  where  we  stopped.  I  do  not  have  the  name  of  the \\nconstituency, but it is the Hon. Abdikadir Mohammed who was interrupted last time.  You may \\nproceed. \\n\\nHon.  Abdikadir  Mohamed  (Lagdera,  ODM):  Thank  you  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to contribute to the president’s speech. First,  I wish to thank my \\nconstituents of Lagdera for electing me to represent them in the 13th Parliament.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I also wish to congratulate you for having been elected to be the \\n\\nDeputy Speaker of this House.   \\n\\nThe President spoke, in paragraph 48, of the ongoing drought in Northern Kenya and \\nthe entire country, saying that climate change was the cause.  He said that the Government is \\ngoing to distribute relief food. The President did not give this matter the seriousness it needs.  \\nIn Northern Kenya, already animals and people are dying. We do not want relief food only; we \\nneed other interventions.  For example, the dying animals need feeds.  The Government should \\nalso distribute animal feeds; and do water trucking.  We need many other things so as to protect \\nthe livelihoods of these people.   \\n\\nWhile  speaking  on  Universal  Health  Care  (UHC),  the  president  said  that  he  will \\nrestructure National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). The NHIF has been over-restructured.  I \\nwas an employee of the NHIF for the last 10 years; it has been over-restructured.  It does not \\nneed to be restructured again.  As it is now, it can handle the issues of the UHC.   \\n\\nThere is also the problem of insecurity in Northern Kenya.  Whenever there is a drought, \\npastoralist  always  clash  because  of  pasture.  So,  the  Government  should  also  address  this \\nparticular issue this time when there is drought in Northern Kenya.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity.  That is all. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you. The Member has donated more time for the next \\n\\nMembers, and I hope that everyone can do that.   \\nIt is now time for MP for Mbeere North. \\nHon. Ruku GK (Mbeere North, DP):  Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me \\nthis opportunity to address the House for the first time.  I tried to be Member for Mbeere North \\nin 2013 and 2017, but failed.  So, for me, this is a dream come true; and it is for this reason that \\nI am grateful and humbled by the trust that the people for Mbeere North have bestowed upon \\nme.  I intend to serve both those who voted and those who did not vote for me.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I am a live to the functions of the House, namely to represent the \\nelectorate, legislate and oversight the Executive.  I am happy that in the inaugural address to \\nthis  House,  the  President  was  emphatic  that  he  expects  legislation  and  oversight  from  the \\nHouse.  \\n\\nTo achieve the purpose of the House, and in order to serve the aspirations of the country, \\nI would urge that we work together, and look at the Bills and Motions that come before us for \\nconsideration and approval.  I say so because there is no Kenya Kwanza Alliance country and \\nan Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance country. The effect of bad laws from the House or \\nno laws coming out of this House will be felt in the entire country.    \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I will, therefore, urge that \\nthe drafters in the House are efficient to ensure speedy drafting of Bills.  I also propose that the \\ndrafters to be around to invite sectoral experts in order to enrich and ensure quality Bills.   \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  as  a  House,  we  need  to  vacate  from  criminalisation  of \\nadministrative functions and processes.  I say so because in the recent past, public officers have \\nbecome overly ineffective as a result of criminalisation of every process in their professional \\nfunctions.  As  a  result,  the  Directorate  of  Criminal  Investigations  (DCI),  Ethics  and  Anti-\\nCorruption  Commission  (EACC)  and  Kenya  Revenue  Authority  (KRA)  among  other \\ninstitutions  are  now  preoccupied  with  hurling  to  court  public  officers  for  the  minor \\nadministrative  mistakes.  That  is  why  I  will  be  proposing  an  amendment  to  the  Public \\nProcurement and Asset Disposal Act 2015.   \\n\\nThis House needs to give impetus to technology, innovation and sustainability in order \\ngive solutions  to  the challenges in  the society,  I  will urge that the House prioritises making \\nlaws that anchor technology as a solution to the challenges that we face as a country. \\n\\nClimate change is a reality, and I will urge this House to consider climate financing to \\n\\nhelp the marginalised communities in this country.   \\n\\nI look forward to serving the country in my new capacity, and I thank you, Hon. Deputy \\n\\nSpeaker. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you, Member for Mbeere North. You were also quite \\n\\nbrief, which means that many of our colleagues will have an opportunity to speak. \\n\\nI now call upon Nominated Member, Hon. John Mbadi. \\nHon. John Mbadi (Nominated, ODM):  Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nLet me start by congratulating you for being elected as the Deputy Speaker of this House.  Last \\ntime I made my contribution, I congratulated the Speaker, but I had not congratulated you.  I \\nhave no doubt that you will lead this House to conduct its affairs diligently and objectively. I \\nalso  hope  that  the  four  Members  who  are  going  to  constitute  the  Speaker’s  Panel  will  be \\nMembers who possess experience and ability to help you run the House.  \\n\\nHaving  said  that,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  allow  me  to  make  my  contributions  to  the \\nSpeech of the President. First, this House has a collective responsibility to oversee and hold \\nthe Executive to account as a unit. I am also a live to the fact that the Minority side of the House \\nor the opposition as it used to be called, has an extra responsibility to even hold the Executive \\nto account much more. I am sure that we are not going to provide parochial opposition, but an \\nobjective opposition. We will support Government policies that are geared towards bettering \\nthe lives of Kenyans and only oppose those  policies which would make us roll back on the \\ngains that this country has made so far. So, you should expect a robust, informed and objective \\nopposition from us, which will help the country to move forward.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the President is taking over a country that is divided right down \\nin the middle; a country where 50 per cent voted for him and another near 50 per cent did not \\nvote for him. This is a country that requires a real symbol of national unity. I am happy that the \\nPresident  indicated  in  his  speech  that  he  is  going  to  run  a  united  country.  He  also  said  that \\nservice delivery is going to be given to all Kenyans in equal measure, regardless of where one \\nvoted, because we are all taxpayers. That is something that needs to be lauded. What we are \\nnow waiting for is action.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the only thing that I would have requested, is that the Deputy \\nPresident also follows what the President has said. I was a bit disturbed when the news came \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 9 \\n\\nout that the Deputy President said something to the effect that it is their turn to eat. I hope he \\nwas misquoted. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, public appointments, including positions of Principal Secretaries \\n(PSs) belong to all Kenyans. Those are positions in the Public and Civil Service, and they are \\nnot supposed to be used as a reward for political support. They belong to all of us, whether one \\nvoted  for  Azimio  la  Umoja  -  One  Kenya  Alliance  or  Kenya  Kwanza.  How  I  wish  that  the \\nDeputy President understood that. So, we expect the Public Service Commission (PSC) to be \\nimpartial, and not to be a victim of state capture.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHaving  said  that,  something  that  worries  me  a  lot  is  that  however  short  or  brief  the \\nSpeech of the President was, I expected it to at least have a line on devolution. If the President \\ncould remember the National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF), which \\nI support, as a very progressive Fund, then I wonder how he could forget to mention something \\non devolution. He even spoke about the Senate Oversight Fund, but he did not say a thing on \\ndevolution. \\nDevolution  is  the  one  thing  that  has  changed  the  architecture  of  governance  in  this \\n \\ncountry since 2013. This is something that should always find space in the speech of a President \\nof the republic of Kenya. I assume it could be because he was summarising his speech, that is \\nwhy he probably left it out among the very many volumes that I saw he did not read. I could \\nsee that the President read a portion of his speech and decided to leave out others. Being an \\nintelligent man, he must have summarised it in a way that we could not even notice that he left \\nout some. I just want to assume that devolution was part of the rest of his speech, because it \\nwould worry me if it did not.  \\n \\nThe President talked a lot about the economy in his short speech, and even proposed \\nthat  he  will  start  by  cutting  our  budget  by  about  Ksh300  billion.  I  thought  that  was  a  bit \\nambitious,  but  I  am  waiting  to  see,  through  the  Supplementary  Budget,  what  the  National \\nTreasury has for us to actualise the pronouncements by the President. However, I do not think \\nthe solution is on the quantum of the Budget as such, or the cutting down of it. I think we should \\nfocus, as a country, on misuse of resources, governance issues and fiscal discipline; what you \\ncould call corruption.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I do not understand why the President finds it hard to call out \\ncorruption by its name. I rarely hear my President talk about corruption. He will always cut \\ncorners and use language that is close to corruption, but he will not call it corruption. I would \\nwant  President  William  Ruto  to  call  corruption  by  its  name.  The  one  thing  that  he  should \\ndisobey  in  his  policy  of  bottom-up  is  corruption.  This  one  must  be  toned  down.  It  must  be \\nfought top-down; you cannot fight it bottom-up. The President, who is the head of this country \\nmust  come  out  forthrightly  and  forcefully  to  call  corruption  by  its  name  and  make  life \\nunbearable for those who are corrupt. These are the people who are making our budget to be \\ninflated and the country to lack resources to implement the projects needed. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to advise the Executive – that is if they can take my advice \\n– that time is running out, and that the honeymoon is over. Today is exactly 30 days since they \\nwere sworn into office, yet the Deputy President is still talking as if he does not believe. If you \\ndo not believe, yet Kenyans are expecting service delivery, do you want us to believe? Please \\nbelieve and start delivering services. We want the cost of living as well as price of fuel to come \\ndown. Do not talk about the Ukraine-Russia war now. During the campaigns, you said that had \\nnothing to do with this crisis. Now we join in saying that Ukraine is very far from Kenya. We \\nwant the price of fuel and petroleum products to come down. The price  of unga must come \\ndown to Ksh80, as we were promised. There is no more time to move around.  \\nThe President has already sold himself internationally as a Kenyan leader. Therefore, \\n \\nwe want him here back home. Very soon, we are going to give you your Cabinet. Once you \\nhave the Cabinet, please perform. Kenyans do not want any more waste of time, because the \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

However,  we  will  support  you  to  make  sure  that  this \\neconomy is resuscitated only with good policies. \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n Hon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Now I call upon the ranking Member for Garissa \\n\\n \\nTownship Constituency.  \\n \\nHon. Aden Duale (Garissa Township, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I will \\nnot take much time in contributing to the Speech of the President. I have done it three times; I \\nhave contributed to the speeches of the late President Kibaki, former President Uhuru Kenyatta, \\nand now to the only President and a friend of mine, President William Ruto.  \\n\\n Hon. Deputy Speaker for the first time, I think his speech was only one hour. Members \\nwho were here last time will remember that the former President Uhuru left his speech halfway. \\nI think he even left it at the Speaker’s place. For those who write speeches, you do not allow \\nthe  President  to  repeat.  President  William  Ruto  did  not  repeat  what  he  said  during  his \\ninauguration, and his inaugural address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). He \\nwill not repeat what he said yesterday, but say what is there today. The key area to pick was to \\nmake sure that the Big Four agenda in the plan are implemented, like the UHC and affordable \\ncheap housing for every Kenyan to live in a decent House where they turn the payment of rent \\ninto ownership of houses. \\n\\n Thirdly  is  to  make  sure  that  Kenya  is  food  secure.  Even  before  his  Cabinet  sits,  he \\nreduced  the  price  of  fertiliser,  which  was  among  his  first  promises.  He  is  dealing  with  the \\ndrought as we speak today. He appointed the six judges who the Constitution had allowed, but \\nbecause of impunity, the former President refused to have them sworn in. He called Safaricom \\nand told them that the owners of  Fuliza are known, and that they should reduce the service \\ncharge by 80 per cent.  Hon. Mbadi, a ranking Member, in 30 days, what President William \\nRuto has done, other Presidents have not done in two years.  \\n\\nFor corruption, watch this space. If you were involved in the Kenya Medical Supplies \\nAgency (KEMSA) scandal or have a file, whether you belong to Kenya Kwanza Coalition or \\nto the opposition, he categorically said he will empower and support financially the oversight \\nin  independent  institutions.  Some  of  those  institutions  were,  for  five  years,  captured  by  the \\nState mandarins. For example, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP), the \\nEACC, the Office of the Auditor-General among others. Hon. Wandayi said that when I served \\nas  Member  of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  (PAC),  that  the  Controller  of  Budget  was \\nharassed  by  the  Cabinet  Secretary  (CS)  for  National  Treasury  and  Planning.  If  there  is  an \\nincident in any constituency, the Inspector-General (IG) of Police today has the capacity and \\nthe financial muscle to do his operations without any hindrance. All these were done within 30 \\ndays. President William Ruto will either be like President Kibaki, who left us with a debt of \\nKsh1.8 trillion, or be better. I am one person who believes that if Kenya will not change under \\nthe  leadership  of  the  chief  hustler,  it  will  never  change.  There  is  optimism  and  a  lot  of \\nexcitement  in  the  region  and  Africa.  Never  have  you  seen  21  Presidents  coming  for \\ninauguration. There used to be a handful of around 10 to 15. Kenya is a hub. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, we have a young, energetic, sober President who only takes tea \\nlike me. He is a good listener, and one who believes in the unity of the people. Since he was in \\nthe Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), the United Republican Party (URP), the Jubilee \\ncoalition,  and  the  United  Democratic  Alliance  (UDA),  he  has  never  appointed  any  of  his \\nrelatives to this House. Compare that. His party has been appointing the marginalised women. \\nHe is a person who listens to them. Let us judge His Excellency William Ruto in a very fair \\nway, even if you are in the opposition.  \\n\\nToday,  I  am  very  happy  that  my  colleague,  a  ranking  Hon.  Member,  has  really \\nconfirmed to all and sundry that he has taken his place in the minority and in the opposition. \\nThis country needs effective and robust opposition. It was not there last time. Last time, we did \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It gave us extra Kshs7 trillion, and that is why we need to reconfigure the budget. \\nIn this House, the budget of the Parliamentary Service Commission must be ready to be slashed. \\nWe must not rush for the Chinese loans anymore. We must borrow, if we have to borrow, from \\nthe multi-laterals that will give us cheaper rates at 3 per cent  for longer periods. We do not \\nwant these Chinese who come with their companies and Kenyans lose because they offload \\ntheir population to Kenya. Imagine a Chinese truck driver in a construction site. This House \\nmust  rise  to  the  occasion.  If  the  House  approves  me,  I  will  not  allow  Kenyan’s  place  to  be \\noccupied by foreigners.  \\n\\nDear colleagues, and because majority of you are new, I really want to ask you to make \\nlaws  that  will  help  our  country.  Even  when  the  Government  brings  laws,  scrutinise  them.  I \\nthink everybody now knows that the ‘deep state’ and the ‘system’ are fallacies. I am sure the \\nchief is no longer deep state. The county commissioners have realised that they are not deep \\nstate. The DPP could not work, as he was under orders to choose which file to take to court. \\nThe EACC had gun on their heads. They were told: “Look for the file of Hon. Aden Duale and \\ndo not take this one.” The Judiciary was muscled. The Controller of Budget could not say that \\ncounties have overshot their recurrent expenditure. Our counties are employing 50 to 60 per \\ncent outside the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act requirement of 35 per cent.  \\n\\nHon. Mbadi and team, you will watch from TV the way this country will change. I have \\nno doubt. In 2002, Hon. Kiraitu Murungi said that President Moi should go home and buy a \\nTV. I am telling you to buy a TV, and may God give you more years to live and watch how \\nHis Excellency President William Samoei arap Ruto will transform this country. Please, buy \\nTV.  That  will  later  come  down.  Hon  Mbadi  and  the  rest,  in  30  days,  we  have  stopped  the \\nsubsidy of petroleum products. I am not a CS, but a Member for Garissa Township.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you need to protect me. I am a Member and I want to thank the \\npeople of Garissa Township. They elected me four times in four different political parties; that \\nis ODM, URP, Jubilee Coalition and now UDA. That tells you that they have the confidence \\nin my leadership.  I moved with President William Ruto, who they told me to walk with. He \\ntook me to ODM and URP, but I did not mind because I was a pastoralist. \\n\\nI am so happy that what I said many years ago – that I will retire in politics when His \\nExcellency William Ruto is in Statehouse – has been achieved; and may God bless Kenya and \\nthe Government of William Ruto. I hope that this House will provide leadership.  \\n\\nI know that we have a very vibrant opposition. We have very good leaders on the other \\n\\nside. Let us all work together to protect the interests of our people. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you.  \\nWe will now have the Member for Konoin, who will be followed by the Member for \\n\\nNandi County, and then the Member for Matungu in that order so that you can be ready.  \\n\\nHon. Brighton  Yegon  (Konoin, UDA):  Thank  you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.   I would \\nlike to thank the people of Konoin for giving me a second chance and voting me for the second \\ntime to be in this House to represent their interests. I also appreciate the people of Kenya for \\nvoting  in  President  William  Samoei  Ruto  and  his  Deputy,  Hon.  Rigathi  Gachagua.  I  also \\ncongratulate you and Hon. Speaker for being elected in the House to serve in this Parliament. \\nIn his Speech, the President captured a number of fundamental issues that are in the \\nKenya Kwanza manifesto. They include food, nutrition and security. The mission to scale up \\nproduction  in  agriculture  while  creating  jobs  is  one  of  the  fundamental  issues  that  was \\nmentioned. Eighty per cent of farming activities in Konoin Constituency revolves around tea. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

In  the  spirit  of  employment  that  is  born  through  agricultural  production,  these \\nmultinationals have exhibited some misbehaviour and bad manners. They have actually sent \\nhome  more  than  15,000  employees  through  forced  early  retirement,  redundancy  and \\ndisciplinary dismissal. This has actually rendered very many of my constituents jobless due to \\nintroduction of tea picking machines. This has done more harm than good.  \\n\\nWe need to call upon these multinational companies to exercise restraint and balance \\nbetween  mechanisation  to  optimize  profits  and  employment.  As  much  as  we  appreciate \\nmechanisation, the multinational companies must also appreciate that the only benefit we get \\nfrom  them  is  employment.  When  they  are  no  longer  employing  our  people,  they  will  have \\noutlived  their  usefulness.  I  am  calling  upon  these  multinational  companies  to  think  about \\nbalancing between mechanisation to optimize profits and employment, so that we can have as \\nmany people as possible employed.  \\n\\nThe President emphasised on the Hustler’s Fund. This is actually to support Small and \\nMedium  Enterprises  (SMEs)  through  affordable  credit  that  will  allow  them  to  expand \\nbusinesses for mama mboga, kinyozi and the boda boda industry for them to thrive and expand \\nin line with the bottom-up economic model.   \\n\\nThe President also talked about matters of water. He talked about raising the target of \\naccess to water from the current 60 per cent to 80 per cent. In my constituency, there was a \\nproject called Bosto Water Project. The water project was supposed to serve five constituencies \\n– four constituencies in Bomet and one constituency in Kericho County. The project was to be \\nfinanced by the Chinese Exim Bank but the previous regime sabotaged it for political reasons. \\nIn the spirit of raising the target of water coverage from 60 to 80 per cent, we hope, pray and \\nbeseech  this  Government  to  jumpstart  the  project  because  the  money  is  still  lying  at  the \\nNational Treasury. So, the project can start as soon as possible and we can access clean tap \\nwater.  \\n\\nThere is the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which the President spoke about. \\nThe NHIF should be restructured to enable it become fit as a social insurance scheme that caters \\nfor all, including those with chronic illnesses. It should cater for terminal diseases like cancer, \\nas the disease has drained many families’ resources. Many families have sold their land and \\nproperty  to  pay  for  hospital  bills.  Since  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Government  has  promised  to \\nrestructure NHIF, we appreciate it. That is a plausible initiative. \\n\\nThe  President  talked  about  the  National  Government  Constituencies  Development \\nFund (NG-CDF). He said it should be aligned to the Constitution because it has had a huge \\nimpact  in  our society. The bursaries that we give to  orphans and other vulnerable people in \\nsociety have helped them to achieve their goals.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. God bless Kenya.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Next is the Member for Nandi County. \\nHon. Cynthia Muge (Nandi County, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I stand \\nhere privileged to be part of the 13th Parliament. This privilege and honour has been bestowed \\nupon me by the great people of Nandi County. I want to pass my sincere gratitude to them for \\nhaving seen value in me by voting overwhelmingly for me on 9th August 2022, to come to this \\nHouse. I want to tell them that I am indebted to them and will ensure that I serve them selflessly \\nand  pay  back  whatever  they  did  on  the  9th  August  by  ensuring  that  I  give  responsive  and \\nresponsible leadership.  \\n\\nI want to say that my voice is their voice in this House.

I will speak for every special group and every boy \\nand man who is trying to find a footing in their lives.  \\n\\nThat said, I am a new Hon. Member in this House. My name is Cynthia Muge. I was \\nborn and raised in Nandi, probably for Nandi and this country at large. I am a daughter, a wife \\nand a mother, all that in one complete package. By training, I am a physical planner who was \\ntrained  and  educated  at  the  University  of  Nairobi,  with  a  Bachelors  and  a  Master’s  degree. \\nEvery person will be wondering how this person ended up in this House. My political journey \\nstarted  five  years  ago  in  2017  when  I  was  a  young  girl,  a  tiny  girl  who  would  pass  for  a \\nuniformed Form Two girl. I went into the murky waters of politics and contested for a Member \\nof County Assembly seat. I ran, and I thank God I was given the opportunity to serve the people \\nof Kilibwoni Ward. I want to thank the great people of Kilibwoni. It is the star and the seed \\nthat they planted in 2017 that has eventually grown very broad leaves that today covers the \\nwhole county. I want to say thank you to those great people.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the easiest part is done. The easiest part was to be elected. The \\nhardest part now begins. The responsibility given to me is no a joke. It is enormous. I come \\nfrom the same village with Chelagat Mutai, who was elected to this august House at the age of \\n24 years. She did a great job in this House. She stood for the people and fought for their land \\nrights. Therefore, the people of Uasin Gishu got land. I cannot fit in her shoes, so to speak. This \\nis because those shoes were worn at a different point in life and in a different era where things \\nwere done differently. So, I will take her lessons seriously and wear shoes of my size going \\nforward.  \\n\\nI hope to speak up in this House, play my constitutional role and represent the people. \\nSo, those I represent and Kenyans at large will see value for their money and every coin used \\nby this Government. Of course, we have the assurance of the President that his administration \\nwill rely on the oversight role of this Assembly. So, I will play that role without demonisation \\nof checks and balances. I hope through me, Kenya Kwanza will be able to implement its plans \\nand fulfil its promises to the people of Kenya.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I want to say a few words about the President’s Speech, which \\nhe  made  last  week.  For  the  first  time,  we  have  a  President  who  is  careful  and  detailed.  He \\nremembered to count the number of women who were elected to this House and the number of \\nMembers who came back. This tells you a lot about him. He is a President whom, during his \\ncampaign  trail,  spoke  about  the  economy.  He  is  keen  on  ensuring  that  the  economy  of  this \\ncountry is back to where it was left by the late Mwai Kibaki and even better.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  remember  that  the  President  also  spoke  about  healthcare.  It \\nshould be noted that any person who speaks about savings is a futuristic person. He is a person \\nwho looks into the future with a view to ensuring that it will be enjoyed by everyone.  He also \\nspoke about the Hustler’s Fund, taxation and housing issues affecting the people of Kenya.  \\n\\nIn as much as many Hon. Members have said that his Speech was short, I want to say \\nthat every person who has the story header has the full story. I want everyone to know that the \\nPresident was trying to be brief and avoid being boring. He had the content, details, plans and \\nroadmap on what will happen in this country.  I hope all the Members in this House will be \\ninstrumental in their representation, oversight and legislation roles to ensure that the President \\ndelivers. \\n\\n Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to thank you, the Hon. Members of this House and the \\ngreat people of Nandi for according me this golden opportunity to speak in this House as their \\nrepresentative.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.   \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Nandi County for keeping time. I now \\ncall upon the Member for Matungu. Thereafter, we will have the Member for Busia County, \\nHon.

Oscar Nabulindo (Matungu, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving \\nme this chance to address the 13th Parliament and talk to the people of Matungu. First, I take \\nthis opportunity to congratulate you for having been elected as the Deputy Speaker of the 13th \\nParliament.  \\n\\nI also want to congratulate my mentor and friend, Hon. Moses Wetang’ula for having \\nbeen elected as the Speaker of this House. I have a history with him because he is my political \\nmentor.  When  I  left  employment  in  Parliament,  he  was  the  first  person  to  embrace  me \\npolitically. He campaigned for me, gave me a ticket in his party and has mentored me up to \\nthis point in time.  \\n\\nSecondly, I take this opportunity to sincerely thank the people of Matungu for having \\noverwhelmingly voted for me twice in a span of two years. First in 2021 and second in 2022. \\nThis is a show of the confidence they have in me. I embrace it, promise to work for them and \\nensure that I achieve what I promised them during the campaigns. \\n\\n Let me take this opportunity to say a few words about the President’s Speech in this \\n13th Parliament. First, I applaud him for acknowledging the fact that the National Government \\nConstituencies  Development  Fund  (NG-CDF) \\nthe  constituencies’ \\ndevelopment. He encouraged us to work out something that can align it with the Constitution \\nso  that  it  can  work  for  the  Members  of  Parliament  and  constituents,  who  are  the  direct \\nbeneficiaries.  \\n\\nimportant  for \\n\\nis \\n\\nBy  all means,  everybody understands that the NG-CDF  is  an important  fund for the \\ndevelopment of constituencies. Millions and millions of children have been educated through \\nthe NG-CDF, and a lot has been achieved. Unfortunately, it is only the Judiciary that does not \\nunderstand the importance of this fund, but that is a matter for another day.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, other than that, I want to register my disappointments. This is \\nbecause the President did not give any commitment on the revival of the sugar industry in the \\nwestern region, and more so the revival of Mumias Sugar Company. I am a representative of \\nthe people of Matungu and for many years they depended on Mumias Sugar Company 100 per \\ncent.  \\n\\nMumias  Sugar  Company  collapsed  with  dreams  and  aspirations  of  the  people  of \\nMatungu and Mumias at large. It is very imperative for the Government of the day to give some \\nimportance to the revival of the sugar industry. We have sleepless nights, and we are saddened \\nwhen the Government of the day decides to ignore the issue of Mumias Sugar Company. This \\nis because it is a very thorny issue to us. The residents of Matungu are desperate since it was \\ntheir only livelihood. We depended on that company 100 per cent to achieve all our dreams. \\nUnfortunately, it collapsed. All efforts to revive the sugar company over the years have failed. \\nFor whatever reasons, everything that has been tried to revive that company has failed. Right \\nnow,  we  have  a  businessman  who  is  trying  to  revive  it  but  there  are  numerous  court  cases \\nongoing to  stop  its revival.  It  is  high time the  Government  intervened  and ensured that this \\ncompany stands on its feet for the benefit of the people of that region.  \\n\\nThe people of Matungu are tired of being told to move from sugarcane farming. We are \\nnot going to move on. This is because sugarcane farming is the only business we know. We \\nhave tried everything else and it has failed. We have tried maize, sorghum, cassavas and even \\navocado farming but nothing works for us. Therefore, we want  our sugarcane back and it is \\nonly  the  Government  that  can  help  us.  If  it  cannot  help  us,  then  we  shall  remain  hopeless \\nbecause we are not going to move on. We are not going to do other things. So, people should \\nstop telling us to move on. We are going to farm sugarcane, and we want it revived. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the issue of youth employment did not come out strongly in the \\nPresident’s Speech. Seventy-five per cent of this country’s population consist of the youths. \\nWhere do we then take them? There is no elaborate plan for youth employment in this country. \\nNeither is there one for people to rise against poverty. We hear of the Hustler’s Fund. If the \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

This  will  enable  them  to  re-plant  sugarcane  and \\nsupply it to  Mumias Sugar Company and other sugar  companies.  If the fund is  utilized that \\nway, it will lead to revival of the sugarcane farming industry.   \\n\\n This  country’s  economy  is  in  shambles  and  everyone  agrees.  Instead  of  the \\nGovernment  joining  the  wananchi  in  crying  about  the  bad  economy,  it  should  give  us  an \\nelaborate plan on what they are going to do to revive the economy in the shortest time possible.  \\nThere is a plan that was elaborated by the President – that, we should cut down costs. \\nInstead, why should the Government not come up with a wealth creation method? We are not \\nin the mood of cutting costs but rather of creating wealth. Nobody is ready to surrender their \\nallowances or whatever they have targeted just because we want to revive the economy. The \\nfirst step is for the Government to give us an elaborate plan on how to revive this country’s \\neconomy, and how small enterprises are going to get a boost or a kickstart to be empowered \\ninstead of waiting to be employed in a white-collar job economy. \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I beg to support. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Can the Member for Busia have the Floor? \\nHon. Catherine Omanyo (Busia County, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n First, I want to thank the people of Busia for overwhelmingly voting me in. It was a \\nlandslide  win  for  me.  I  will  not  take  it  for  granted  because  the  task  ahead  of  me  is  to  keep \\nserving them.  \\n\\nI  have  issues  I  want  addressed  and  become  history  in  Busia  County.  They  include \\nchildren  crossing  swamps  in  order  for  them  to  get  to  school,  release  of  fishermen  jailed  in \\nUganda for not fishing on the Kenyan side of the lake, and helping widows, elderly persons \\nand Persons living with Disabilities (PWDs)in order for them to know that they now have a \\nmother.  I want to thank them for believing that I can take care of them. \\n\\nThe President, in his Speech, did not mention Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) \\nfood  but  he  is  nonetheless  already  implementing  it.  Is  he  ignorant  of  the  disadvantages  of \\nGMOs? From where I sit, GMOs are toxic to our bodies and cause loss of nutrition. We already \\nhave children and adults who are suffering from malnutrition in Kenya. Why then should we \\nbring such a thing to our nation?  They also cause cancer and antibiotic resistance. As Members \\nof Parliament and leaders of this nation, we should be brought to knowledge of some things \\nbefore they are introduced to us. Kenya has natural habitats and very fertile soils. We would \\nnot like to downgrade it. \\n\\nThe President also did not mention the issue of perforated boundaries yet we recently \\nwitnessed Kenyans dying like chicken in Baringo yet the people who perpetrate the killings are \\nknown. As a mother, I wept. Nobody should be sleeping pretty waiting to dig graves in Kenya. \\nWe want to lead people who are alive and Kenyans should not live in fear. \\n\\nThank you.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Tigania West. He seems not to be here. We can \\n\\nthen have the Member for Ugenya. \\n\\nHon. David Ochieng’ (Ugenya, MDG): Thank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\nAllow me to join fellow Members in congratulating you for being elected the Deputy \\nSpeaker of the 13th Parliament. I know who you are. I know that you take matters seriously. \\nThis Parliament is in good hands with you as the Deputy Speaker.  \\n\\nAllow me to also take this opportunity to thank the people of Ugenya, who against all \\nodds have stood with me to see me come back to Parliament even when everyone thought I \\nwould not. Even those who cared had written me off.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Some  people  think  that  they  just  happen.  We \\nmust thank Kenyans for being peaceful, civil and mature democratically. You will appreciate \\nthe  fact  that  our  democracy  is  growing  and  maturing  if  you  see  what  happens  in  our \\nneighbouring countries. A time will come when elections will just be a matter of course, and \\nwill not cause jitters and panic in the country. If you looked at status of the economy before \\nthe elections and now, and if you remember what we went through during the elections, you \\nwill appreciate the fact that the President recognizes that we have come far in our democracy, \\nwhich  is  very  important.  The  fact  that  our  democracy  is  maturing  should  not  be  taken  for \\ngranted.  We  must  continue  nurturing  it.  The  President  has  promised  to  run  an  accountable, \\nopen and transparent Government. As the National Assembly, we must encourage him to do \\nso. Those of us in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance, will ensure that the President carries out his \\nrole in a manner that follows the law. \\n\\nAs someone said earlier, our President is not averse to criticism. He does not want us \\nto be a choir in this Assembly. He has said that he does not have monopoly of knowledge. He \\nwants to share the views of the people of this country and Parliament to ensure that what the \\ncountry  needs  gets  into  his  thinking  and  interacts  with  his  thoughts.  He  has  said  that  this \\nParliament should not be timid and sit back but should oversee his Government accordingly. I \\nwant to invite all of us to give the President the challenge and ensure that he runs a Government \\nthat responds to the needs of the people.  \\n\\nSecond and most important, is the place of education in the growth of our economy. \\nThe hustler nation does not mean that we throw education out and anything goes. The hustler \\nnation means that everybody who has a chance and wants to get an education, who wants to \\nget his or her papers right or who wants to grow by ensuring that his or her children accesses \\nthe best quality education in this country, is able to get it. The President wants to run a country \\nbased on merit. So, I ask all of us not to give up on education. It is a key thing. That is why \\nwhen I hear the courts rule that anybody can run for governor or Member of Parliament, and \\nthat education does not matter, I feel that we are sending the wrong signals. \\n\\n I ask all of us to ensure that wherever we come from, education is the only equaliser to \\nanything in this world. If you did not go to school, you will not end up anywhere. Investing in \\neducation is something that we must keep talking about so as to ensure that we are led by the \\nbest as a country. The former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, said that you must \\nbe led by the best in your midst and those who know what is required in the country.  \\n\\nThe President talked about investing in agriculture. Our country is agriculture-based. \\nAs a people, we must ensure that we become food secure. How do we do so? We must invest \\nat  the  lowest  levels  of  the  economy.  Everyone  who  wants  to  farm  should  be  able  to  access \\nquality and affordable seeds, whether they are avocados, cotton, maize, millet or potatoes, as \\nwell as fertilisers. Let us ensure that everybody who is willing to use his or her energy to benefit \\nand earn a living in this country is supported. That is why we will ensure that this Parliament \\nsorts out the supply and demand constraints on agriculture. Let us ensure that our people are \\ntaught. Let us bring back the service officers that used to help us in agriculture. Let us ensure \\nthat our people know the modern methods of farming, cooling milk and that our farm produce \\ndoes not go to waste because we do not have storage facilities.  \\n\\nIrrigation is very important for food security and stability.

We must ensure  that the money is  used for the right  reasons.  Corruption should not \\nseep into monies meant to benefit our people. \\n\\n I have heard so many Members say that the President did not talk about corruption. I \\ndo not believe that barking and shouting at corruption makes it go away. The approach adopted \\nby our President to ensure that institutions that are supposed to fight corruption are well-funded, \\nwell-resourced and well-equipped speaks for itself.  \\n\\nI was in  the last Parliament  when the former President brought  us a list of Principal \\nSecretaries and Cabinet Secretaries who he claimed were corrupt. To date, none of them has \\never been convicted by a court of law. I do not think we should ask our President to talk about \\ncorruption. We should ask those whom we have given that job to do by law. There is no law \\nthat requires the President to fight corruption. The law that was passed by the Assembly, and \\nthat  which  is  set  out  in  the  Constitution,  establishes  the  Ethics  and  Anti-Corruption \\nCommission  (EACC)  as  the  body  that  fights  corruption;  not  the  President.  We  want  the \\nPresident to ensure that he does not try to stop any prosecutions or investigations. However, \\nsaying that the President must talk about, or fight corruption is quite weak.  \\n\\nWe have had guys who talked about corruption every day, saying that they would fight \\nit and deal with it but people steal right under their noses, and they do not talk about it. The \\napproach  by  the  President  to  nurture  institutions  is  the  best.  On  this  issue,  I  insist  that  the \\nDirectorate of Criminal  Investigations (DCI), the EACC and our courts are to blame. As an \\nAssembly, we must ensure that we put them on their toes, not the President. Corruption seeps \\neverywhere  in  this  country,  including  in  nursery  and  primary  schools.  There  is  corruption \\neverywhere you go. I do not think the President has a thousand eyes to check how we live. In \\nmy opinion, fighting corruption requires a concerted effort. We must all play a role. We should \\nnot just say corruption is bad and when you are found to be corrupt, you say it is a witch-hunt. \\nWe must put the blame where it lies.  \\n\\nThe President proposed a very good housing project. All we need to do as an Assembly \\nis to ensure that if a house is being built in Kisumu, the doors are bought in Kisumu. If you are \\nbuilding houses in Kakamega, let the doors, hinges and windows be produced in Kakamega. \\n\\nFinally, Hon. Deputy Speaker, this President means well. We cannot pray that he fails. \\nIf he fails, we fail. I ask all of us here, both the Majority and the Minority sides, to pray for this \\nPresident to succeed. Let us help him succeed for if he succeeds, we succeed; and the country \\nsucceeds.  \\n\\nThank you so much.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us hear the Member for Baringo North.  \\nHon. Joseph Makilap (Baringo North, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First \\nand foremost, I thank God through the people of Baringo North, who gave me an opportunity \\nto become a Member of Parliament in this 13th Parliament, a dream that started in 1984 when \\nI was in Standard Four. When I saw Parliament then, I said that that was truly where I shall be \\nin  many  years  to  come.  I  also  thank  the  people  of  Baringo  North  in  all  their  wards,  their \\nreligious  leaders,  those  who  prayed  for  me  and  the  Simba  ni  Moja  campaign  team,  which \\ndelivered victory in military precision.  \\n\\nI also thank the people of Baringo North, together with the people of Kenya, for giving \\nHis Excellency the President William Samoei Ruto an opportunity to become the fifth President \\nof the Republic of Kenya, together with his Deputy, Rigathi Gachagua. More specifically, over \\nthe weekend, the people of Baringo North told me to convey thanks to the people of Mount \\nKenya who gave us many votes, together with other Kenyans who gave us an opportunity to \\nelect His Excellency President William Samoei Ruto as our fifth President.  \\n\\nAs elected representatives, we had an opportunity to elect you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nand the Speaker of the National Assembly. I congratulate you first, as citizens, secondly, as \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Congratulations,  Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, together with the Speaker of the National Assembly.  \\n\\nNow  turning  to  the  President’s  Speech,  His  Excellency  President  William  Ruto  is  a \\nproduct of God’s work. This is a man who was fought by all manner of things, including by \\nthe  system,  Government  machinery  and  State  capture  but  through  prayers,  none  of  them \\nsucceeded. It gives us freedom as a country that the son of a pauper from a village, like me, \\nwhose first mattress was the skin of a cow, can one day rise to become the President of Kenya.  \\nI also want to congratulate the Members who have been elected for the first time, just \\nlike myself, to be in this 13th Parliament. They are being referred to as ‘monos’. We may be \\n‘monos’ here, but mentally we are not ‘monos’ and we cannot be taken for a ride. We have the \\npower to debate and propose legislation that can actually change the country into a positive \\ntrajectory. To our senior colleagues, I also want to congratulate you because you utilised the \\nNational Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) well and it brought you \\nback here. Teach us how to come back the next time we face elections. \\n\\nOn the President’s Speech, the Kenya Kwanza Government has a bigger mandate across \\nthe political divide in this country. In the last election, William Samoei Ruto got 25 per cent in \\n39  counties.  The  performance  has  progressively  moved  from  30  counties  in  2013  and  34 \\ncounties in 2017 to 39 counties in this year’s election. That means he has a broader mandate \\nand acceptance across Kenya. That is why immediately the results were announced and even \\nduring the Supreme Court judgment, Kenyans kept their cool and gave the country a breathing \\nspace to be able to transact business. \\n\\nOn unity of purpose, we have one President. Any other person is subject to the President \\nand must transact business in a manner that is acceptable to all Kenyans regardless of how they \\nvoted in the last election. Similarly, whether my constituents voted for me or not, I will serve \\nthem justly because it was a competition. Once we have a winner, we should treat all people \\nthe same way without discrimination. Even the nominees for Cabinet appointment are spread \\nacross Kenya. That brings unity in our country.  \\n\\nOn the matter of what is called Fuliza, access to credit by the people of Kenya is not \\nenough. I want to congratulate the President for intervening, but it is not enough. I was doing \\nresearch and realised that the base interest rate of the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates \\n(UAE) is 4.5 per cent. I am looking forward to a time when a borrower in Kenya will access \\nloans at 3 per cent per annum so that they will be able to do business. For a long time in this \\ncountry, Kenyans have been working for banks instead of banks working for Kenyans. I will \\nbe one of those Members of Parliament who will propose legislation to bring down interest \\nrates charged on Kenyans who borrow money to do business. That is the only way we can make \\nprofits, have businesses that prosper and even reduce taxes. \\n\\nThe biggest town in my constituency is called Kabarnet. Women go to Uganda to bring \\nclothes.  I  wonder  how  people  go  to  a  landlocked  country  like  Uganda  to  buy  goods  and \\nservices.  Why?  It  is  because  there  are  too  many  taxes  in  our  country.  We  should  look  at  a \\nsituation where we reduce taxes, including Value Added Tax (VAT). If we were able to reduce \\nVAT during the outbreak of COVID-19, why can we not reduce it now when the situation is \\nnormal? We should reduce VAT to 12 per cent so that Kenyans can do business. The ‘hustler \\nnation’ Government talks about spreading bottom taxes so that we have more productivity but \\nwe can also reduce VAT and PAYE. The other day when we were being served with payslips, \\nI could see money being given by the right hand and taken by the left hand. As Members of \\nthis House, we must look at legislation to ensure taxes do not become punitive to the people of \\nKenya. We must reduce taxes to attract investors to bring money to our country so that we can \\ndo much more and develop as a country. \\n\\nI  want  to  agree  with  His  Excellency  the  President  on  the  issue  of  agriculture  and \\nirrigation. Hon. Members, if we do not ensure food security in this country—if our stomachs \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let us first of \\nall sort out food security so that we have food on the table for people to work. We can even \\nmove from a middle-income economy to a first-world economy. If we can practise irrigation \\nand stop reliance on rain-fed agriculture, we shall change. \\n\\nFinally, if we sort out school fees, food and health services through Universal Health \\nCoverage (UHC), this country will change for ever. We will have sorted out the fundamentals \\nthat  affect  human  life.  I  want  to  rest  my  case.  In  the  coming  years,  I  will  do  more  in  this \\nParliament to reshape the direction of development in this country. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Now we will have the Member for Isiolo County \\n\\nafter whom we will have the Member for Kilifi North and the Member for Naivasha. \\n\\nAllow the Member to make his intervention. \\nHon.  Ibrahim  Saney  (Wajir  North,  ODM):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker.  This \\nbeing the last afternoon to discuss the Presidential Address, I kindly seek your indulgence to \\ndirect the House to reduce time allocated for each Member to five minutes so that we can have \\nample time to contribute to the Speech. In as much as we know that we are yet to make our \\nmaiden speeches, I implore you to reduce the speaking time for each Member to five minutes. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Given that the debate had already begun, that can only happen \\n\\nif the House so agrees. There was another intervention by the Member for Kajiado East. \\n\\nHon. Kakuta Maimai (Kajiado East, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I want \\nto second the proposal by the Member. Every Member wants to get an opportunity to contribute \\nto the Speech of the President. So, I support. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, since it is not procedural to change speaking \\ntime in the middle of debate, I think that is something Members can agree upon. Whoever gets \\nthe next opportunity, try to make your contribution as brief as you can. Some Members have \\nalready done so. I think we can proceed. \\n\\nMember for Isiolo. \\nHon. Mumina Bonaya (Isiolo County, JP): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I wish \\nto take this opportunity, first of all, to thank the Almighty Allah for his guidance and goodness \\nthat  has  seen  me  through  all  the  hurdles  in  my  journey  to  this  House  as  the  people’s \\nrepresentative. I also wish, in a special way and with so much humility, to thank the people of \\nIsiolo for the honour, trust and confidence they conferred on me by resoundingly electing me \\nas  their  county  woman  Member  of  Parliament  against  all  odds.  Indeed,  Isiolo  people \\ndemonstrated the meaning of democracy in its truest form by electing me to the 13th Parliament, \\nin an election that was intensely contested and strongly characterised by, sadly, not real issues \\naffecting  ordinary  people  or  competencies  on  the  part  of  candidates  seeking  leadership \\npositions,  but  by  narratives  that  were  heavily  informed  by  tribal  and  clan  entitlements, \\nendorsements  and  formations  that  almost  destroyed  the  social  fabric  on  which  Isiolo \\ncommunities advance their well-being.  \\n\\nAs  their  representative,  I  proudly  stand  here  today  to  celebrate  the  resilience  and \\ndetermination that was shown by the ordinary people of Isiolo County in maintaining peace \\nand brotherhood in  their grand match to  the ballot,  where they  expressed their will through \\ntheir votes as the ultimate decision makers. On this day, I make a solemn promise not to let \\nthem down but to serve them diligently. \\n\\nI will now move on to matters which affect the people of Isiolo County, which is arid \\nand  semi-arid.  I  would  like  to  refer  to  the  Address  by  His  Excellency  the  President  on  the \\ndrought situation in our country and interventions that have been made by the Government so \\nfar. I wish to clearly state here that the situation on the ground has now moved from drought to \\nfamine.  People  are  now  dying  of  hunger.  There  is  no  water  for  both  human  and  livestock \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We appreciate the food consignment that was flagged off by His Excellency the \\nPresident. However, I wish to state here that, looking at how the situation is evolving, more \\naction needs to be taken urgently so as to save both human lives and livelihoods. \\n\\nContinuous food relief is needed from now until five to six months after the rains. When \\nit rains, hunger persists up to when farmers harvest first and animals bounce back strongly. I \\nadvise that in future, food distribution should be guided by the number of households in a  \\nsub-location and the population in an area. I am saying this because I am sad to report to this \\nHouse that the consignment that was flagged off by His Excellency the President ended up at \\nhousehold level as just one kilogramme of rice and one kilogramme of beans. Looking at the \\nsituation  on  the  ground,  this  will  not  change  anything,  if  we  are  actually  serious  about \\naddressing the situation. \\n\\nOnce  again,  the  President  talked  about  climate  change.  He  pointed  out  climate \\nmitigation measures that include reducing greenhouse emissions to lessen the effects of climate \\nchange. While we appreciate that, what the President’s Speech missed out was the adaptation \\npart of climate change. As we all know, the effects of climate change are already upon us. We \\nmust find ways to cope with it. This needs to happen at both national and local levels. As a \\ncountry, we will continue experiencing the effects of climate change in the foreseeable future. \\nIt is important that we begin the journey on how we can cope with it. \\n\\nIn this regard, for effective adaptation to take place, as a country, we need to invest and \\nmake use of climate information in all our planning and development decisions. It is not right \\nthat we are always surprised by failed rains and the drought situation in our country. As such, \\nwe fail to act in good time to save lives and livelihoods. \\n\\nI am still debating on the President’s Address. I was saddened by the fact that he did \\ntouch on the security situation in my county and the entire Northern Kenya. For a very long \\ntime now, insecurity in Northern Kenya, and specifically in Isiolo County, has been a matter \\nof great concern. For example, Merti Sub-County has now become a battle field where militias \\nfrom  Wajir,  Marsabit  and  Samburu  East  walk  in  at  will,  kill,  maim  and  drive  off  herds  of \\nlivestock  belonging  to  the  locals,  with  so  much  impunity.  Lack  of  security  has  displaced \\nfamilies. Schools have closed down and Government services  are not  being rendered to  the \\npeople. Strategic water points and grazing areas like Mathasathen, Yamicha, Nyachis and Kom \\nhave been abandoned by locals. This makes Isiolo people more vulnerable to the biting drought \\nsituation as they now lack access to key resources that were once their drought fall-back areas. \\nA week hardly ends without an attack from these neighbours. Over the last three years, \\nwe buried a countless number of people with no trace and hope of recovering the herds of cattle \\nthat have been stolen. To put the matter into correct perspective, the pastoralists and their herds \\nof cattle in Isiolo County survive severe drought situations only to be killed and their herds of \\ncattle  stolen  by  militia  from  Wajir,  Marsabit,  Garissa  or  Samburu  East.  This  has  gone  on \\nunabated for far too long. As a matter of urgency, it is time the State moved in to look into the \\nunderlying  drivers  of  these  conflicts  with  the  intention  to  address  the  matter  decisively  and \\nrestore back respect for people’s lives and their properties, as guaranteed in our Constitution. \\nAs  I  conclude,  I  wish  to  make  an  appeal  to  the  Government,  Non-Governmental \\nOrganisations (NGOs), well-wishers and all Kenyans to remember the Kenyans who are now \\nstarving to death. We need to come together in the Kenyan spirit, like we have always done, to \\nsave the situation.  \\n   \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kilifi North. \\nHon. Owen Baya (Kilifi North, UDA): Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nFirst, I would like to congratulate you on your election as our Deputy Speaker. I wish \\nyou all the best  in  your  new role. You have previously served this august  House very  well. \\nEspecially, when you were in the Committee on Delegated Legislation, we  saw your ability \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I would like to thank them for electing \\nme despite the fact that I vied on a ticket of a party that faced a very hostile environment in that \\nregion. However, God was there and I am here. \\n\\nThirdly, I would like to congratulate and to note with thanks the President’s Speech. He \\nspoke with passion, commitment and the heart of a man who is ready to take up the challenge \\nof  leading  this  country  to  the  next  level.  The  President  reiterated  that  this  country  and  our \\ndemocracy have come of age. For the first time, we have six more women who were elected to \\nthis House. Therefore, we have increased their numbers. That gives us confidence that women \\nleadership is on the rise. This is exhibited even more by having a female Deputy Speaker in \\nthis House. This further reiterates the President’s sentiments. I look forward to having more \\nwomen leaders in this Parliament so that we can bridge the gender gap. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, if you look at the elections again, as noted by the President, this \\n  \\ntime we had 39 counties that voted for the President. That is up from 34 counties in the previous \\ngeneral election. What does this mean? This country is becoming more tolerant. Our democracy \\nis becoming more mature. Our democracy is taking shape given that we can now vote not based \\non our ethnicity but on ideas and national agenda. People can now cast their votes based on an \\nagenda put on the table. People in this country voted on an economic agenda. Everybody felt \\nthe economy was going down. Everybody understood that we had to have better ideas on the \\neconomy. Every voter knew that it was the economy that was hurting most of us. Therefore, \\nthey  went  to  the  ballot  and  voted  for  one  William  Samoei  Ruto  because  he  had  a  better \\neconomic agenda.  \\n\\nI would like to tell Kenyans that however tough the economic times are, we have better \\ndays ahead. These are just the pangs someone feels when giving birth but we are looking at a \\nbetter  Kenya  in  terms  of  the  economy.  I  want  to  assure  them  that  those  of  us  in  the  Kenya \\nKwanza Government will strive to make the economy better. We have the ideas, the minds and \\nthe people. You have seen for the first time a President who is not talking about anything else \\nbut the economy. He left the comfort of his office to go to where Safaricom and other players \\nwere together and he talked about Fuliza. Today you saw him at the National Stock Exchange \\n(NSE) talking about how to make the NSE available to everybody. He is a President who is \\nkeen on serving the country and changing the economic fortunes of this country.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  this  country  cannot  move  forward  unless  and  until  we  are \\naccountable for the resources given to us. This Parliament must put its foot down to look at \\naccountability. We have had haemorrhage of resources. This country lost a lot of money in the \\npast  regime  through  corruption  and  dubious  projects  that  were  being  done  to  serve  other \\npeoples’ pockets and not this country. We had the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) \\nscandal  and  roads  that  are  being  built  at  a  cost  that  is  so  astronomical  that  even  baffles  the \\nengineers who designed them. Somebody sitting at a table is briefed by engineers that a road \\nwill cost us Kshs10 million but he says, “No, make it Kshs30 million.” That is the amount of \\nmoney that we have spent and it is unnecessary. That is why I support the President when he \\nsays  that  we  can  comfortably  cut  the  Budget  of  this  country  by  Kshs300  billion.  We  can \\ncomfortably  do  that  because  many  projects  done  by  the  past  regime  have  had  exorbitant \\nunnecessary costs to them.  The costs were estimated not by engineers but because somebody \\nelse said, “I want to make money out of this project. Therefore, increase the cost.” \\n \\nI  want  to  tell  Kenyans  that  this  Parliament  must  stand  firm.  Even  those  of  us  in  the \\nKenya Kwanza Government must stand firm to hold this government  accountable for every \\ncent that we give it so that Kenyans can have value for money.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, one of the things I would like to speak about, which the President \\n \\ntouched on, is  about  having confidence in  our independent  institutions like the  Independent \\nElectoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and the Judiciary. Immediately after the court \\nruling, people started lambasting the Judiciary. Just because they lost a case, they want to make \\nthe  whole  world  believe  that  we  have  the  worst  Judiciary.  What  about  those  international \\nbusinessmen who are looking at coming into this country because they have confidence in the \\nJudiciary of this country? A time has come that when you lose a case, you dust your coat and \\ngo home. You say you have lost fairly instead of lambasting the Judiciary. The Judiciary has \\nhad a bad name just because one person lost a petition. The IEBC has been vilified just because \\nsomebody lost an election. \\n\\nFellow Members of Parliament, I would like us to build confidence in our institutions. \\nThat is the only way to move the democracy of this country forward. It is one of the things that \\nthe  President  noted.  More  importantly  is  that  this  country  needs  to  come  together.  The  last \\nelection pulled the ends of this country. It is time we brought this country together. The 13th \\nParliament could  be the organ to  bring this country together.  It  is one of the things that the \\nPresident  talked  about.  Fellow  Members,  it  is  time  we  preached  peace,  national  cohesion, \\ntogetherness and unity and brought this country together again so that the divide or the archaism \\nthat  has  been  brought  about  because  of  an  election  can  end.  We  should  bring  this  country \\ntogether, start working together as a nation, and build a cohesive country. That is the only way \\nwe can take this country forward.  \\n \\nAs I congratulate you, Hon. Deputy Speaker and the Hon. Speaker Wetang’ula, I would \\nalso want to thank the Kenya Kwanza brigade. I also thank the President for giving the Coastal \\nregion opportunity to have one of our own as the Speaker of the Senate. This is something that \\nis commendable. The people of the Coast know that this Government has taken care of their \\ninterests, for the first time. As we move forward, there are things that must be taken care of. \\nThe issue of water, especially in Kilifi and Ganze constituencies, is serious. I would like the \\nPresident to keep his promise—that he will build big dams there to ensure that the people of \\nKilifi do not die of hunger again. \\n \\nThe question of landlessness or squatters at the Coast needs to end in this Government. \\nAs I wind up my speech, I would like to ask fellow Members of Parliament some things. As \\nwe move together in the 13th Parliament, let us move on a bipartisan agenda and approach so \\nthat we can heal this country and move forward. God bless Kenya.  \\n\\nThank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Let us have the Member for Naivasha. The Member \\nfor Wajir will follow so that he does not  come up here. Then we will have the Member for \\nKericho, and so on. Most of you will have a chance.  \\n\\nThank you. \\n \\nHon.  Jayne  Kihara  (Naivasha,  UDA):  Thank  you  for  this  chance,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker.  I  will  make  my  contribution  short  because  my  kid  brothers  here  tell  me  that  their \\nconstituents are watching. They are on the television wanting to see them speak. I will make it \\nshort.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nFirst  and  foremost  is  to  congratulate  you  on  your  election  as  the  Deputy  Speaker, \\ntogether with the Speaker. I know you are equal to the task. We have come a long way. We \\nhave done a lot of work for our party and President right from the season of wamama. I would \\nalso like to plead with our President to give positions to our fallen soldiers—the ladies who \\nwent round this country campaigning for this Government.  \\n \\nI wish to congratulate all the Members who found themselves in this House, whichever \\nroute they used to come to this place. We know it was rigorous and difficult. So, it is upon us \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  applaud  Kenyans  for  the  way  they  conducted \\nthemselves during the elections. This is the most peaceful election that has happened in this \\ncountry in a long time. As leaders, we all owe it to Kenyans. We should applaud them because \\nof the way we did our politics. \\n \\nThe President spoke about the many things he is prepared for. What we know is that \\nwhat he said is what he means and this is what he wants to do for this country. This is what he \\nwent  round  promising  Kenyans.  We  know  he  is  a  sober  President,  hands-on  and  very \\nhardworking. We know this is going to happen.   \\n\\nI  also  wish  to  thank  him  for  giving  us  a  Cabinet  Secretary  from  Nakuru,  which  has \\nnever happened since Independence.  The First Parliament had Mark Mwithaga as an Assistant \\nMinister.  We have also had Mirugi Kariuki, Koigi Wamwere, Gitahi Ngaruro, Lee Kinyanjui \\nand myself, who have served as assistant ministers in previous Governments.  For once, we \\nhave a Cabinet Secretary, Zachary Njeru, and we thank the President for that. \\n \\nOn the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF), I was in \\nthe  pioneer  committee  when  the  relevant  law  was  passed,  which  was  sponsored  by  Eng. \\nMuriuki Karue.  I have also been a wife to a Member of Parliament who did not have the NG-\\nCDF.  This made me hate politics because I would see my husband sell cows and the whole \\namount would be donated to building classrooms or for development.  The NG-CDF is the best \\nthing that ever happened in this country.  It is upon all of us to support the NG-CDF, so that it \\nis aligned to the Constitution.  As I speak, the many students who we take to school through \\nthe NG-CDF that have been sent home. We have just come from  campaigns and we do not \\nhave anything to give to them when they come to us.  This is one of the things that we must \\nsupport. \\n \\nThe  President  talked  about  the  Competency  Based  Curriculum  (CBC).    The  CBC \\ntaskforce  is  very  important.    I  have  been  to  schools  and  found  mothers  knitting  for  their \\nchildren.  This makes one to wonder whose assignment that is.  Whose work will the teacher \\nmark for? The taskforce is important because we do not want to scrap off the CBC, but we \\nwant to get the best. \\n \\nOn drought in the country, many people have said that it should be declared a national \\ndisaster.  There are families that sleep without food.  As we wait for agricultural products and \\nfertiliser prices to be lowered, let us address the current drought situation. \\n \\nThe President also talked about the Universal Health Care (UHC).  I wish to thank the \\nPresident for nominating women to the Cabinet.  The current number of women in the Cabinet \\nis the highest we have had in this country. He had promised that 50 per cent of his Cabinet \\nwould be women. This did not happen, but at least, as women, we have got the biggest chunk \\nin his Government.  \\nI  wish  to  congratulate  the  single  constituency  women  Members.  This  is  the  greatest \\n \\nachievement.  In the 8th Parliament, we had eight women, which means there were only two \\nelected at the constituency level because the rest were nominated.  In the 9th Parliament, we \\nwere 18, with only 12 elected.  This time round, we are 29 women and we were 23 in the last \\nParliament.  We are catching up.  At this pace, you may find the gentlemen fighting for the \\none-third gender principle.  As women, we should work hard and give Kenyans the confidence \\nthat we can do better than our male colleagues.   \\n \\n\\nI support the President’s Speech. \\nHon. Ibrahim Saney (Wajir North, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Every \\nspeaker before me has congratulated you and the Speaker for your election.  I know you have \\nbeen  inundated  with  so  many  congratulatory  messages.  I  wish  to  join  my  colleagues  in \\ncongratulating  you  for  your  election  as  the  Deputy  Speaker  and  the  Speaker  himself.    That \\nposition is well deserved. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

They elected me to \\nParliament in the 11th Parliament, sent me on leave in the 12th Parliament and they felt wise \\nthat I should be back to represent them in the 13th Parliament.  For that, I am grateful and I shall \\nremain indebted to them. \\n\\nFast-forward to the Presidential Speech, I am proud to have elected His Excellency the \\nPresident.  I come from an area that is majorly painter orange and red and it was not easy to \\nwin on a United Democratic Alliance ticket. It was not an easy battle to face seven Azimio La \\nUmoja-One Kenya Alliance candidates against one from Kenya Kwanza. Luckily, I triumphed.   \\n\\nThe President’s Address was apt on the various issues facing the country.  Of concern \\nto me were issues of constitutionalism. His Excellency the President appointed the six judges \\nwho had gone through the due process in their recruitment, as was done by the Judicial Service \\nCommission. The only role left for the then President, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, was to \\nappoint the six judges.  That was not done.  However, I am happy that the newly elected Fifth \\nPresident of Kenya has fidelity to the law and has appointed the six judges accordingly.  I am \\nalso happy that in his Address, he affirmed that the Judiciary Fund shall be operationalised. \\nThis is a great move towards constitutionalism. He also emphasised the fact that the Judiciary \\nshall cascade its services to the constituency level, taking justice to the people, so that they can \\nhandle the many cases by the locals at the grassroots, more so commercial and corruption cases.   \\n\\nI was taken aback when a previous speaker mentioned that the President did not address \\ncorruption issues.  Actually, the President made a bold undertaking that he would devolve the \\nJudiciary to the constituency level to ensure that commercial and corruption cases are expedited \\naccordingly.  This is the first time this is happening in the history of this republic. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the President has brought  hope to the rule of law by ensuring \\nthat the Inspector-General of Police is the accounting officer as espoused in the Constitution, \\nand that this is fully implemented. That was a bold move that we expected from him and he did \\nit in the first few days in office. \\n\\nThe other issue that the President addressed is that he implored the House to review the \\nStanding  Orders  so  that  we  can  have  the  Executive  on  the  Floor  of  this  House  for  us  to \\ninterrogate them on matters policy and service delivery. That is welcome, but we should be a \\nbit cautious on matters of separation of powers.   Separation of powers is  thin and it is  well \\nneeded.    We  must  not  confuse  different  arms  of  Government,  but  it  is  important  that  this \\nHouse’s previous position is restored to when the Question Time was the most interesting time \\nof debate in Parliament. \\n\\nFurther, the President talked about agriculture.  He emphasised that it is important to \\nhandle maters of production than the easy approaches to levies and subsidies.  I appreciate his \\nmove and I feel that it is the right way to go.  He spoke about agriculture from an expert oriented \\nposition. \\n\\nOn matters business environment, Kenya is the first, if not second, in Africa and the \\nworld, most unequal country.  The GDP is in the hands of 8,300 people only, according to the \\nlatest statistics from Oxfam. About 8,300 own 99 per cent of the GDP of this country.  The \\nPresident  emphasised  and  promised  that  he  would  improve  on  the  business  environment  to \\nmake sure that the inequality gap is reduced accordingly. \\n\\nFurther, he talked about the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in regards to access to \\nwater.    He  promised  to  increase  access  to  water  from  60  per  cent  to  80  per  cent.  That  is  a \\nwelcome move. Water is a basic need, more so in the rural communities and in Arid and Semi-\\nArid  Lands  (ASALs).  In  as  much  as  I  appreciate  his  approach,  emphasis  is  given  to  either \\npublic or foreign investors who have the bigger muscle and what happens ordinarily is capital \\nflight. I would urge the President to consider small-scale investors so that they can also go into \\nthe partnership to sell and deliver water to earn money. Otherwise, the approach with regards \\nto the PPP is welcome and that brings me to the Bute Water Pan, which is a presidential flagship \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 25 \\n\\nproject he has been following for the last ten years. I hope he will consider the Bute Water Pan \\nin Wajir as part of the PPP that he promised \\n\\nOn the UHC, the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) as it stands carries the name \\ninsurance, but  really does not  operate like an insurer.  It  comes under the regulation  and the \\nsupervision  of  the  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority  as  it  is  in  our  statutes,  but  every  year,  it \\nrequests for a waiver, so that it is not supervised like private insurance companies. That is to \\ntell  you  that  it  is  always  hiding  behind  the  name  insurance.  It  does  not  collect  premiums.  I \\nactually appreciate the approach the President has taken to overhaul the NHIF and rebrand it \\nto make sure it is a universal health care giver.  \\n\\nFinally, I can see the lights are on, but the President emphasised on drought, which is \\nravaging Wajir North and other ASALs areas. I think we need to reconsider and re-strategise \\non matters drought. We must bring on preparedness so that we can mitigate drought before it \\nstrikes. Otherwise, I appreciate and support the President’s Speech. Thank you, Hon Deputy \\nSpeaker. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Thank  you,  Member  for  Wajir  North.  I  actually  took  you \\nseriously when you said that you wanted the time limited to five minutes. Obviously, it did not \\napply to you, maybe to the other Members.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nI now call upon the Member for Kericho, Member 001 of the 13th Parliament. Kindly \\n\\nhelp her with the microphone. \\n. \\nHon. Beatrice Kemei (Kericho County, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for \\ngiving  me  this  opportunity.  First,  I  thank  God  for  enabling  all  of  us  to  be  here  and  most \\nimportantly, for the peaceful elections.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to congratulate you in a very special way for being \\nelected to that position. Receive greetings from the people of Kericho especially the women. \\nIn  the  12th  Parliament,  there  were  some  fracas  on  the  Floor  of  the  House  and  the  late  Hon. \\nLaboso had water poured on her. This time round, the women told me to be there for you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, before anything of that nature happens. I will always wear flat shoes to enable \\nme swing to your defense. \\n\\nSecondly,  I  congratulate  the  Speaker,  who  is  a  seasoned  politician.  He  deserves  this \\nposition having risen through the ranks in Parliament for all the years. I would like to thank the \\npeople of Kericho County who gave me the opportunity to come to Parliament. This is a dream \\nthat I had for so many years. I remember when I was in Class Six, we had a debate between the \\npupils in Class Six and Class Seven, entitled “A teacher is better than a donkey driver”. I was \\na proponent of the donkey driver. I was not eloquent, but I somehow represented my class and \\nwe won the debate. It was at that point that I appreciated my debating skills.  As I thank the \\npeople of Kericho, I must confess that being Member No. 001 in the 13th Parliament is no mean \\nfeat.  My  making  it  to  the  13th  Parliament  is  by  God’s  grace  and  the  trust  by  my  people  of \\nKericho. I promise that I will work hard and discharge my duties diligently as per the oath that \\nI took to oversee, legislate and represent.  \\n\\nToday, being the International Day for the girl child, I believe the Speaker may have \\nknowingly or unknowingly allowed you the opportunity to preside over today’s Sitting. I pray \\nthat every girl child in this country enjoys this day.  I dedicate my speech to the many girls who \\nare in school, the women who are working hard to support their families and put food on the \\ntable, and those working in tea and coffee plantations, quarries and mama mbogas (grocers). \\nAs we celebrate the girl child today, I pray that we do not just support them materially, but \\nencourage them to be more innovative, creative and fight for their space.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I appreciate the President who upheld the two-third gender rule when it came to \\nthe appointment of the cabinet secretaries. He said he did his part and I believe this House will \\nuphold all the nominees for the positions. I congratulate Hon. Florence Bore, my predecessor. \\nI am here because she got another position, but I hope this House will uphold her position. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  there  are  many  issues  facing  women  such  as  gender-based \\nviolence  (GBV).  We  have  cases  of  suicide  happening  around  the  country  particularly  in \\nKericho County. We have many stressed women in need of psychosocial support. I commit to \\nwork closely with the three arms of Government especially the Executive and the Legislative, \\nto ensure that women have their space. \\n\\nThe  President’s  Speech  was  just  the  best.  It  was  very  short,  but  full  of  wisdom.  He \\napplied what we call the mini skirt rule; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to \\nmaintain  interest.  At  the  end  of  the  Speech,  Members  were  very  excited.  He  gave  us  his \\nroadmap towards implementation of the bottom-up economic model approach. He highlighted \\nthe key steps in which the Government intends to use to achieve full realisation of his agenda. \\nAs I said, he appreciated the women leadership. \\n\\n Secondly, he talked about investing in agriculture by reducing the cost of production. \\nThis is very important and we will review the legislation that will moderate issues on export \\nand taxation of agricultural products. Agriculture is key in Kenya. This is the main area that \\ngives us economic empowerment. I pray that we put more emphasis on the same. We are not \\nonly concerned about food security, but economic empowerment. \\n\\nOn UHC, the President is concerned about a more effective, affordable and efficient \\nsystem.  In his  plan, he talked about  maternity  and the provision  of diapers for women with \\nchildren under three months. This made me think of getting one more child to appreciate the \\nGovernment’s program of free diapers for three months. I will come so that we can discuss and \\nI think you should join me. We appreciate the Government in supporting women by providing \\ndiapers  for  three  months.  That  will  help  our  women  who  have  children.  Our  health  is  our \\nwealth, and this will be good for us. \\n\\nOn the issue of housing, it is very important that we have the land, but more importantly, \\nwe should also have other enablers so that the housing programme can help many of our people.  \\nI see the lights are on, but I want to add one more point. Our people are waiting for the \\nHustler  Fund.  They  already  have  groups.  We  want  to  see  it  done  in  the  right  way.  The \\ndepartment at the Ministry that will take care of the Hustler Fund will have to do it well so that \\npeople do not miss out. Hustlers are waiting for it and they are ready to be helped. This will \\ncover everybody. It will help mama mboga, all the hawkers and everybody who is concerned \\nwith this. \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Member  for  Kwale  County?  Since  the  Member  for  Kwale \\nCounty is not here, we can have Member for Webuye East. Yes, honourable investor, Martin \\nWanyonyi, as the name says. Is that correct?  \\n\\nHon. Martin Wanyonyi (Webuye East, FORD-K): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nfor giving me this opportunity. I am honoured to speak for the first time on the Floor of this \\nHouse on behalf of the people of Webuye East. I want to congratulate  you, Madam Deputy \\nSpeaker,  for  your  election.    I  also  want  to  congratulate  our  Speaker,  Hon.  Moses  Masika \\nWetang’ula, for his election as our Speaker in the 13th Parliament. \\n\\nI  also  want  to  congratulate  my  great  people  of  Webuye  East  for  the  trust  and  the \\nconfidence they bestowed upon me as their third Member of Parliament. I was born in a very \\nhumble, but a hardworking family, a family that trusted in my capability of being somebody \\nand also my possibility of pursuing my God-given dream. When I was born, I was blessed with \\ntwo  very  important  things.  One  of  those  things  that  I  was  blessed  with  is  this  condition  of \\nalbinism. I am certain that if today you visit Mandera County or any other part of this country, \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Even  on  the  face  of  the  system,  the  deep  State  and  the  Government \\nopposition, he was elected. I also want to congratulate and thank my Speaker because he led \\nthe team and the region that made the difference in who was elected President and who lost. I \\nwant to thank him for the support and for the relationship that he gave us.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, it is also said that to whom much is given, much is expected. I \\nwon in all the wards in my constituency. I am inheriting a constituency that is still very young, \\nthat has been in existence for only 10 years under the 2010 Constitution. My people are in need \\nof infrastructure. Schools are still not doing well, and many people lost their families and their \\nmarriages broke up because of the collapse of Pan Paper. I just want to promise them that my \\nexperience as a MCA - being nominated in 2013, elected in 2017, now elected as Member of \\nParliament - is a true testimony that I lead what Kenya Kwanza stands for. I am a true testimony \\nof  how  bottom-up  can  work.  Being  nominated,  elected  as  an  MCA  and  now  a  Member  of \\nParliament, I am sure the sky is the limit. Tutapanga maneno hapo mbele. \\n\\nI want to assure my people that we are going to do whatever we can. We are going to \\ngo out of our way to ensure that we realise every plan, every strategy and every manifesto that \\nwe promised them. I just want to ask them for their support and walk with me in this journey \\nso that we can transform our constituency together. \\n\\nFrom the outset, I just want to thank the President for his Speech. Through it, he was \\nable  to  demonstrate  that  he  does  not  believe  in  quantity,  but  in  quality,  preciseness  and  in \\nunequivocalness. This is why his Speech was precise, simple and to the point.  I want to also \\nthank the President because while the former President, Uhuru Kenyatta, believed so much in \\nbig  things  and  initiating  big  projects,  I  am  happy  with  the  current  President,  the  Kenya \\nKwanza's and the Fifth President.  I want to thank him because he believes in very simple and \\nfew things that are important  to  the Republic of Kenya and its citizens.  That  is  why in  the \\ninaugural Speech, he talked about universal healthcare and the transformation of agriculture. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members who are at the bench, your exchange with the \\nclerks is amounting to harassment as I can hear the conversation.  We still have three hours and \\neveryone who is on the list will get a chance to speak. You may proceed. \\n\\nHon. Martin Wanyonyi (Webuye East, FORD-K):  Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nI do not know whether they are doing that because I am the one speaking. I just want to continue \\nby saying that I thank the President for his Speech, his belief in very few, simple, but important \\nthings  to  the  Kenyan  people.    The  transformation  of  agriculture,  the  achievement  and \\nimplementation of the universal healthcare and the housing program are all being conceived \\nwithin Article 43 of our Constitution.  Article 43 on economic and social rights is so critical \\nand forms part of the centrality of our Constitution.  We have not done well in the last 10 years \\nin terms of actualising this particular Article in our Constitution.  I thank the President for his \\ncommitment to ensuring that Article 43 of our Constitution is achieved and is made alive and \\ntrue to the citizens of the Republic of Kenya.  \\n\\n I also thank the President for his Speech on the issue of having the cabinet secretaries \\nappear before Parliament and answer questions directly.  Concerns are raised by the Members, \\nbut we have a presidential system where we have never had absolute democracy.

Deputy Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kitutu Chache South \\nHon.  Anthony  Kibagendi  (Kitutu  Chache  South,  ODM):  Thank  you  for  this \\nopportunity, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I first want to congratulate you and the Speaker for your \\nelection to the offices in the National Assembly.  I would also like to take this opportunity to \\ncongratulate all the Members, elected and nominated.  I take this opportunity to congratulate \\nthe  President  and  his  Deputy  on  their  election.    Mine  is  a  unique  story  of  sheer  resilience, \\ndetermination and relentlessness.  My story should inspire young people of this country that \\njust like Eliud Kipchoge says: ''No human is limited'', we should never give up. My political \\njourney started while in campus in 2007. I ran for elections in 2013. In 2017, I came close to \\nwinning. Without losing enthusiasm, in 2022, I got elected overwhelmingly by the people of \\nKitutu Chache South.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the wonderful people of Kitutu \\nChache South for electing me to serve them.  I thank team Kibagendi, those are the people who \\nwere running the campaign and I hope we will continue working together.   \\n\\nThe President gave a short and inspiring Speech. I particularly appreciate his focus that \\nhe wants to work towards, namely, lowering the cost of living and aligning the NG-CDF with \\nthe  Constitution  since  the  Fund  has  been  life-changing  especially  on  matters  to  do  with \\neducation and security in the countryside.   \\n\\nOn matters to do with the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB), I have been a victim of being \\ndenied a loan because of a small default I had with a mobile loan and that injured my standing \\nin society.  \\n  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the President spoke very much about food security, agriculture \\nand various other issues like the universal health care. I want to confirm that Kitutu Chache \\nSouth is the only constituency in the larger Gusii region that has no inch of tarmac other than \\nthe highway going to Kisumu.  We are hoping that we will be considered this time round.  \\n\\nI wish to also appreciate the former Member of Parliament Hon. Richard Onyonka, and \\nthe Constituency Fund Manager, Mr. Kimutai, for the wonderful job they did.  We have great \\nprojects that have been done by the NG-CDF.   \\n\\nI wish the Member for Garissa Township stayed longer. He is an excellent debater and \\nI wish he could be with us.  He should have turned down the opportunity to serve as a Cabinet \\nSecretary and join us in the House, so that he can help us in checking the Executive because he \\ndoes a very good job.  Even today, he pushed our party chairman to buy a television and watch \\nhow His Excellency William Ruto will do his work. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I served as an advisor to our President while he was the Deputy \\nPresident and I have no doubt he will do a wonderful job with the opportunity that he has been \\ngiven.  I hope the opposition will be objective and focus on its role unlike what we witnessed \\nin the past five years where we did not seem to have a proper opposition that was checking the \\nexcesses  of  the  Executive.    I  hope  the  Executive  will  focus  on  its  mandate  and  not  open \\naggressive policies like we saw in the past where they failed to honour court orders.   \\n\\nFinally, I hope the President and his Cabinet will instil discipline especially in the Civil \\n\\nService.   \\n\\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. I again want to thank the people \\n\\nof Kitutu Chache South for allowing me to serve them.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, you will all get an opportunity. Be patient with \\n\\nthe clerks, we will get to you because we still have until 8.00 pm. Thank you. \\n\\nMember for Baringo County.   \\nHon. Jematiah Sergon  (Baringo County, UDA): Thank  you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nFrom the outset, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate you and Hon. Speaker for being \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I also want to congratulate our President, His Excellency Dr. William \\nSamoei Ruto, who is a man of his words. He is ready to serve and is a dedicated man of God \\ntoo.  I assure all of you that I will give him unconditional support going forward.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I was privileged to be part of Kenya Kwanza and now I am an \\nelected  Member.  I  also  participated  in  their  campaigns.  I  must  say  that  in  his  Speech,  the \\nPresident spoke rightfully about what we always talked about in our campaigns. For me, what \\nI captured most was the issue of social security.  \\n\\nAs you are aware, this country is heavily indebted by foreign debts. The President said \\nthat  as  a  country,  we  can  help  one  another  through  saving  and  borrow  from  our  savings  to \\ndevelop ourselves and the Government can also use this money for infrastructure and building \\nof  schools.  If  you  read  his  Speech,  he  clarified  that  social  security  in  Kenya  especially  the \\nNational Social Security Fund (NSSF) is so much undermined because of poor saving culture.  \\nHe encouraged all of us to save more. The format used now shows that the people who \\nare  keen  on  saving  are  the  ones  in  formal  employment  especially  Civil  Servants.  Many \\nKenyans, the young generations, those who never went to school, and those in the private sector \\nwork every day and hustle.  These people should be encouraged to save, so that we can have \\nan opportunity to develop this country. \\n \\nHe also talked about innovations through the present-day technology. I am very much \\naware that all of us, as Members of Parliament, are tech-savvy in one way or the other. We are \\nalways exposed to electronics. The President, through his Speech, encouraged us to be more \\ninnovative.  He  also  encouraged  the  young  generation  to  be  innovators  and  find  ways  of \\nmarketing  their  products.  They  should  do  as  much  as  possible  to  help  this  country  going \\nforward through technology because it is here with us forever.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because of time, I want to reiterate that I was a bit disappointed \\nby the President’s Speech because he did not mention insecurity matters. I come from Baringo \\nand as a daughter of Baringo, I have witnessed and faced many problems because of insecurity.  \\nInsecurity in the Kerio Valley belt is mainly associated with cattle rustling and banditry \\nthat has destroyed the wealth of families.  People are becoming poor because this matter has \\nbeen there for ages, and has never been tackled and eradicated fully. I expected the President \\nto be keen and give direction because his Speech was on the State of the nation. As I speak, I \\nwant to tell the august House that banditry is one of the menaces that have claimed the lives of \\nKenyans, and police officers. These are people we have given opportunity to take care of our \\nlives and our property. \\n\\nA week before the President gave his Speech, we lost several policemen and women \\nand civilians through a raid that occurred in Lokori in Turkana. I will read their names because \\nunfortunately they were not mentioned by the President during his Speech in the House. You \\nmay  think  that  cattle  rustling  is  only  happening  in  Baringo,  but  it  is  affecting  everyone  in \\nKenya. The officers were William Karimi, Alex Wambua, John Kisoi, Boniface Mutiso, Edwin \\nOmari, Eric Rugut, Brian Macharia, and Augustine Ndiema. We also lost our dear sister, Mary \\nKanyaman, who was a biochemist, one of the learned daughters of the soil of Turkana. We also \\nhave others who were injured like Raphael Gituro and Peter Ng’ang’a. This is something that \\nwe cannot wish away. Going forward, as a Member of Parliament, I will bring Bills to help us \\neradicate this matter. Why am I so much affected by this? This is because I come from Baringo \\nwhere  we  are  adversely  affected  by  this  menace.  Banditry  is  manufactured  in  Tiaty \\nConstituency.  \\n\\nI am saying this because as the Member of Baringo County, I have the prerogative and \\nauthority to mention this on the Floor of the House, so that we can solve this problem right \\nfrom  the  source.  As  I  speak,  there  are  killings  and  displacement  of  people  and  innocent \\nchildren. I just came from Baringo on Saturday and we buried one gallant soldier, who was \\nserving as a General Service Unit (GSU) officer in Barwessa Ward.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

His son watched keenly with a sombre mood as his father was \\nbeing buried. He did  not  move and even when they were doing the gun salute, the boy just \\nstared at his father’s coffin. It is not about the bandits, but the people that are left behind. We \\nlack psychosocial support. The families are left poor and dejected. They do not know where \\nelse to go, especially those who are displaced and do not know what to do next. At the end of \\nthe day, it looks like it is business as usual for the Government and the country. People are \\nbeing killed and no one discusses it afterwards. We just go and bury them.  \\n\\nI want to urge this Parliament to, with the help of all Members here, kindly let us work \\nhard to enable other Kenyans, especially those in Baringo and Kerio Valley belt, to have the \\nsame peace as other people in this country.  \\n \\nbehalf of the people of Baringo alone, but for future generations.  \\n\\nI want to conclude by saying this is our world and Kenya today. I am not speaking on \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you, Member for Baringo. Let us have the Member for \\n\\n \\nKisumu Central. He is not here? Member for Starehe Constituency? Member for Mathare. \\n \\nHon. Anthony Oluoch (Mathare, ODM): Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nFrom the outset, allow me to join fellow Members who have congratulated you on your election \\nas Deputy Speaker. I have no doubt that you and Hon. Speaker, both distinguished lawyers and \\njurists, will take this House to heights higher than where you found it.  \\n \\nFrom  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  say  that  I  am  a  student  of  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  a \\nlawyer by profession. If I have turned out to be a poor or good lawyer, she would be responsible \\nfor it, but I am sure it is the latter. In my final year of school, I was among the top 10 students \\nwhom  she  took  to  Washington  DC  to  the  Philip  C.  Jessup  International  Law  Moot  Court \\nCompetition. I am happy that we did a good job under her leadership and stewardship.  \\n\\nI was in the 12th Parliament and saw the zeal and industry that she put in the committees \\nshe was in,  especially the Select  Committee on  Delegated  Legislation.  I  am  sure that if she \\ntranslates that zeal to the House, we will be so much the better. So, I congratulate you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, as I also congratulate the Speaker.  \\n\\nThis is my second term, but it is my third attempt at being a Member of Parliament. \\nWay back in 2013 when I was still trying to cut my political teeth in the same constituency, \\nHon.  Speaker,  Moses  Wetang’ula,  was  gracious  enough  to  call  and  give  me  my  first  direct \\nticket as a member of the FORD-Kenya Party. I returned with 8,000 votes and I am eternally \\ngrateful for that opportunity.        \\n\\nI also thank the people of Mathare for electing me for a second time to represent them \\nin  a  very  diverse  constituency  -  one  that  is  the  face  of  Kenya.  If  you  come  to  Mathare \\nConstituency, you will find every conceivable tribe there. If you think you will be elected in \\nMathare  by  your  tribal  majority  or  numeracy,  you  will  be  shocked  because  if  I  were  to \\nbenchmark it against my tribe, I am actually third in terms of numerical numbers. I do not take \\nit for granted.  \\n\\nSecondly, there is a slang phrase they use in Mathare “hapa unanawa mara moja.” If \\nyou were to translate it, it simply means that  you wash  your hands once.  Every Member of \\nParliament before me served for only one term and exited. So, I thank them.  I will take my \\nwork seriously and diligently. We laid the foundation in the first term, and I will do everything \\npossible to ensure that the trust and confidence that they have bestowed upon me as the people \\nof Mathare shall not be disappointed.  \\n\\nLastly on that issue, before I go to the Speech, I thank my family for constantly and \\nsteadfastly standing behind me throughout the last campaigns and the previous ones. I thank \\nthem.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wanted to paraphrase the skirt principle \\nthat was alluded to by the Member for Kericho. My law professor, another one, not the current \\nSpeaker, used to say that when you are faced with a question in an exam paper, a good answer \\nto a question is like a lady’s skirt. It is short enough to excite and long enough to cover the \\nsubstance.  Well,  the  jury  is  still  out  as  to  whether  the  President’s  Speech  excited  the  base \\nenough.  When  I  say  “base”,  I  mean  the  election  promises  that  were  made  under  the  Kenya \\nKwanza plan. The jury is still out, in my view, as to whether it was long enough to cover the \\nsubstance. Listening to a number of Members, quite some ground was covered, but there are \\nother issues that were not quite well-covered.  \\n\\nSecondly, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wanted to speak to the issue of the tone. In my view, \\nthe tone of the Speech was moderate. This was an opportunity for the President to try and bring \\ntogether the more than 6.9 million Kenyans who still felt aggrieved, for one reason or the other, \\nand those who did not vote for him. However, to my disappointment, looking at Paragraph 11, \\nif I was to quickly glean through what the President said, it amounted to a trolling of his chief \\nopponent,  the Right  Hon. Raila Amollo Odinga.  In that  paragraph, he said that it is  only in \\nKenya  where  a  sitting  Deputy  President  becomes  the  candidate  of  the  opposition,  and  the \\nopposition  leader  becomes  the  candidate  of  the  Government,  and  that  the  candidate  of  the \\nopposition  becomes  the  President.  I  thought  that  was  an  opportunity  not  to  rub  salt  in  the \\nwounds  of  the  6.9  million  people  who  he  clearly  stated  at  his  inauguration  that  he  will  be \\nPresident of, whether they voted for him or not. I thought that that was an opportunity to try \\nand rally everybody together, both the seven million who voted for him, and those who did not.  \\nGoing forward, I hope presidential speeches will be corrected. These include the ones \\nthat I witnessed at the burial of the Deputy President’s brother, where some of our Members \\nstill seemed to be in an election mood and were trying to pull back the President into rubbing \\nsalt in the wounds of the losers in a manner that suggested that while the people who lost have \\nmoved on and are trying to heal, the victors apparently seem to find pleasure in trying to bring \\nthose people back and rubbing salt in their wounds. Going forward, I hope the President will \\ncorrect that. \\n\\nThe  first  point  that  I  noted  that  I  want  to  speak  to  is  on  the  issue  of  oversight.  In \\nParagraph 16 of the Speech, the President indicated that he would try to ensure that institutions \\nwork, that Parliament provides oversight, and that members of the Cabinet are here to answer \\nQuestions as part of enhancing that oversight.  \\n\\nI would like to go back to Paragraph 11 and paraphrase it. He said that it was only in \\nKenya  where  we  have  a  sitting  deputy  elected  as  president,  the  opposition  leader  being  the \\ncandidate of the Government, and that opposition candidate being elected president. It is also \\ntrue that it is only in Kenya where an elected President, in his first 30 days, makes it his business \\nto implement one of the main campaign platforms and policies of the opposition leader. I thank \\nhim for this because when he says he wants to bring cabinet secretaries to Parliament, is that \\nnot the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) that was shot down by the current President and his \\nteam? This is an attempt at implementing piecemeal some of what we proposed in the BBI.  \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetang’ula) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\n \\nI  also  want  to  speak  on  the  issue  of  the  independence  of  the  Judiciary.  I  was  in  the \\nDepartmental  Committee  on  Justice  and  Legal  Affairs  as  well  as  the  Select  Committee  on \\nImplementation of the Constitution in the last Parliament. I support the President in terms of \\nthe Judiciary Fund, which he promised would be put in place. I also thank him that within the \\nfirst few days, he swore in the judges who had not been sworn in. Those are good gestures, but \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Both  are  wrong.  If  the  Judiciary  gets  into  bed  with  the  Executive,  I  will  quote \\nAlexander Hamilton who once said in his Treatise of 1889 that, while the Executive holds the \\nsword and dispenses honours, and Parliament holds the purse-strings, the Judiciary dispenses \\njustice. That is the last vanguard; the last place where members of the public would go if they \\nwere offended. It would be a big disservice to Kenyans if the Judiciary, in an attempt to give \\nback to the Executive what it has extended to them, got into bed with it.  \\n \\n\\nI see that my time has run shorter than the 10 minutes that…   \\nHon.  Speaker:  Your  time  is  up,  wakili.  Let  us  have  Hon.  Richard  Yegon  of  Bomet \\n \\nHon. Richard Yegon (Bomet East, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me \\nthis opportunity to make my Maiden Speech as United Democratic Alliance Party Member of \\nParliament for Bomet East Constituency. I wish to take this earliest opportunity to congratulate \\nyou on being  elected the Speaker of the National  Assembly.  I  also  congratulate the  Deputy \\nSpeaker, Hon. Boss Shollei, and my colleagues who made it to the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nEast. \\n\\nIt has been a long and winding journey for me to be here having attempted twice to \\nsecure  the  party  ticket  for  the  final  run  in  vain. In  this  year’s  UDA  party  primaries  and  the \\nsubsequent general election, God and the voters were on my side. In what I take as payback for \\nconsistency and persistence to offer leadership to the great constituency, to my immediate and \\nextended  family  members  and  friends  who  stood  by  me  through  a  very  difficult  time,  my \\ncampaign team that went an extra mile to deliver the win, I am for ever indebted to you. Many \\nthanks and respect go to the voters, the youth and the elderly, who woke up at dawn, braved \\nthe chill, the scorching sun and long queues to cast their votes. They waited for hours on end \\nas the votes were counted, tallied by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission \\n(IEBC) clerks and results finally announced by the Returning Officer. The voters believed in \\nmy cause and ensured that we won. I will not let you down. \\n\\nTo those who opposed my candidature and to my competitors, former area Member of \\nParliament,  the  Kenya  African  National  Union  (KANU)  Secretary-General,  Mr.  Nick  Salat, \\nDr. John Kalia of Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) Party, you were worthy competitors. We all \\nengaged in issue-based politics devoid of tricks and character assassination. True to all tenets \\nof multi-party democracy, the best candidate won. I wish to reiterate that it is time for us, the \\npeople,  to  tilt  the  coin  in  the  way  we  operate  in  identification  and  implementation  of \\ndevelopment projects for the benefit of the residents. I am looking forward to working with the \\nnational  and county  governments,  all stakeholders, donors and residents  in  finding a lasting \\nsolution to the socio-economic challenges facing the constituency. \\n\\nThere  is  little  footprint  of  development  projects  in  Bomet  East  Constituency  by  the \\nJubilee  administration  of  former  President  Uhuru  Kenyatta.  The  administration  can  only  be \\nremembered for the stalled upgrade to bitumen standard of the 75-kilometre Tenwek-Merigi-\\nTegat-Chemaner-Kimuchul-Mateja  and  the  Chemaner-Kembu-Longisa-Kipreres-Kaparuso-\\nKembu-Koibeyon-Mulot roads. Hardly one kilometre was constructed before funding of the \\nproject was withdrawn a year ago for what is believed to have been a move by the then powers \\nto punish the residents for their political affiliation.  \\n\\nI  am  confident  that  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Government,  through  the  able  leadership  of \\nPresident William Ruto, will prioritise completion of the projects which were starved of funds, \\nincluding the Longisa-Kipreres-Sigor Road whose tender was awarded, but construction is yet \\nto take off. Before being elected, it is on record that I was able to channel my own resources \\ntowards improving the 17-kilometre Tegat-Chemaner-Kembu Road in response to numerous \\nappeals from residents. This was only a stop-gap measure.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Residents of the region are in the long-term looking forward \\nto the upgrade of a number of roads to bitumen standard, including Kapkeshego-Kiromwok-\\nSabaret-Kipyosit-Tegat  Road.  We  should  prioritise  the  Mulot-Mengit-Toronik-Kipreres-\\nCheboin-Meregi-Kong’otit-Chepkitwal and Lekimbo-Cheboin-Chepkolon-Injerian roads.  \\n\\nDespite the fact that water is a key enabler of development, Bomet East, which is highly \\nagriculture-endowed,  has  eventually  been  faced  with  acute  shortage  of  the  precious \\ncommodity. Water shortage, for both domestic use and irrigation, affects all the five wards in \\nthe constituency, namely, Kembu, Merigi, Chemaner, Longisa and Kipreres. I wish to thank \\nthe African Development Bank (ADB) for funding the ongoing extension of water pipelines to \\nLongisa  and  Mulot  trading  centres  in  a  bid  to  ease  the  acute  shortage  of  the  precious \\ncommodity. As a long-term solution,  I appeal to  the national Government, under the Kenya \\nKwanza  Coalition,  to  fast-track  the  implementation  of  Kibusto  Water  Project  in  Chemaner \\nWard. The project, identified in early 1980s, has the potential of supplying water by gravity to \\na larger part of Bomet East Constituency and is highly cost effective. \\n\\nTo  spur  economic  growth  and  improve  people’s  livelihoods,  I  will  be  engaging  the \\nnational  Government  to  connect  electricity  to  households  under  the  last-mile  connectivity \\nprogramme, even as we push for new lines to be rolled out.  \\n\\nI  am  glad  that  in  response  to  concerns  raised  by  the  people,  the  President  set  up  a \\ntaskforce to review the Competency-Based Curriculum education system, which will identify \\nschools to be made centres of excellence in the constituency so that we can rally donors on \\ntheir construction and equipping to accommodate bright but needy students.  \\n\\nWith agriculture being the driving engine of the Kenyan economy, it is noteworthy that \\ngrowing tea by small-scale farmers and dairy farming are the main sources of livelihood for \\nthe residents following the collapse of the maize sector due to the maize lethal necrosis disease \\nfor more than fifteen years, hence the negative impact on food security in the region. The uptake \\nof avocado farming on subsistence and commercial scales has steadily  risen in  the last four \\nyears. We will walk with the stakeholders to construct a pack house for farmers to sell their \\nproduce through export to fetch higher prices. The recent move by the Government to set up \\nan ICT centre in Mulot, specifically as a software development hub in the country, is highly \\nappreciated. It is a welcome move that will go a long way in demonstrating that there is a huge \\npotential for rural areas to drive Kenya’s industrial growth. We, men and women in the House, \\nlook up to you and the House leadership for guidance as we learn the ropes of legislation, which \\nis what voters have sent us here to do. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Thank you., Hon. Members. I know we can vote on reduction of time, \\nbut with consensus,  I see we have about 83 requests. Today is the last Allotted Day. If  you \\nagree, we can have five minutes per Member so that we can have as many of you as we possibly \\ncan to make your speeches on this Presidential Address. Is that agreeable? \\n\\nHon. Members: Yes. \\nHon. Speaker: Excellent. If you make your points in less than five minutes, you will \\nbe even more appreciated. Hon. Joseph Kahangara. If you can make it in less than five minutes, \\nyou are excellent. \\n\\n Hon.  Kahangara  Mburu  (Lari,  UDA):  Thank  you  very  much,  Hon.  Speaker,  for \\ngiving me this opportunity to contribute. I will try to make it as short as possible to enable other \\nMembers to make their contributions.  \\n\\nThis being my first time to speak in the 13th Parliament, I take this opportunity first to \\nthank the Almighty God for giving me favour among the people of Lari. They found me fit to \\nrepresent  them  in  the  13th  Parliament  for  the  second  time.  I  thank  the  people  of  Kinari, \\nNyanduma, Kamburu, Kijabe and Lari/Kirenga Wards who voted for me overwhelmingly on \\n9th August to be their Member of Parliament. \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I will remain forever indebted to them for the work that they did for \\nme. \\n\\nAs I talk to the people of Lari, let me also take this opportunity to condemn the acts of \\narson that are taking place in our area. Two schools were burnt in as many weeks. I urge the \\nteachers and the schools’ administration to  work together to  ensure that  our schools remain \\nsafe. A lot of effort and resources are put together by parents to put up the schools. When they \\ngo up in smoke, it is very unfortunate.  \\n\\nI will now go to the President’s Address. Our Kenya Kwanza Coalition Candidate, His \\nExcellency the President, went round this country, into every corner and county, and collected \\nviews from  Kenyans. He asked them what  they  would  expect  him to  do when he forms  the \\nGovernment. He came up with what we called “The Plan”. This is what he explained in his \\nspeech here. He explained what he would do for Kenyans. \\n\\nLet  me just pick out  a few issues that affect  my people in  Lari.  I  come from  a rural \\nconstituency where over 90 per cent of my people depend on agriculture. His Excellency the \\nPresident talked about value addition. Whenever we produce excess products, most of them go \\nto waste because the market is saturated. The President talked about value addition. This means \\nthat  we  can  keep  our  products  longer,  export  the  same,  earn  more  money  and  create \\nemployment for our people.  \\n\\nThe other main challenge that we face in agriculture is that, sometimes, we are unable \\nto get our products into the market because of poor infrastructure. It is my hope that the current \\nGovernment will take up the ongoing projects, especially the Mau Mau roads, and ensure that \\nthey are completed. The Government should also come up with more road projects, so that our \\npeople can get their produce to the markets. \\n\\nOn  the  same  agriculture,  the  President  talked  about  the  reduction  of  the  price  of \\nfertilizer from Kshs6,500 to Kshs3,500. We have already seen that some of that product has \\nbeen taken to the people. However, the people of Kiambu County only have a store in Thika \\nTown  where  we  have  the  National  Cereals  and  Produce  Board  (NCPB).  People  from  Lari \\ncannot go there. We ask the Government of Kiambu County to devolve the same, so that the \\nproduct can be taken to every sub-county.  \\n\\nAmong  other  things,  the  President  spoke  on  the  issue  of  National  Government-\\nConstituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). As another Member has said, people are now \\nasking for bursary which we do not have. He said that he served as a Member when there was \\nNG-CDF and when it was not there, and he knows what it means. We are happy because we \\nnow have goodwill from the Executive. Let us get NG-CDF back, so that we can serve our \\npeople better. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Mheshimiwa. Woman Representative for Mombasa. \\nHon.  Zamzam  Mohammed  (Mombasa  CWR,  ODM):  Ahsante  sana,  Mhe.  Spika. \\nNaitwa  Mhe.  Zamzam  Chimba  Mohammed.

Ningependa  kumwambia  Mtukufu  Rais  kuwa,  kwa  hisani \\nyake, heshima na taadhima, afuatilie jambo hili ili wakaazi wa Mombasa wasiwe wakutolewa \\nkafara na bandari yetu ichukuliwe. Wakenya wote wachangie jambo hili. Tuchange pesa hizi \\ntunazodaiwa na Mchina ili zilipwe na Wakenya wote. \\n\\nNingependa pia kumwambia Rais kuwa tuna maliasili na rasilimali zetu, kama wakaazi \\nwa  Pwani,  kama  vile  korosho  na  madini.  Ningependa  kumshawishi  na  kumuelezea  kuwa \\naturahisishie barabara ya Dongo Kundu iweze kufunguliwa mapema, ili tuweze kupata ajira na \\nkufungua viwanda ambavyo vitaleta ajira kwa vijana wetu wa Mombasa. Wengi wamepotea \\nkatika  mihadarati.  Wengine  wanachukuliwa  na  ushawishi  mkubwa  kwenye  mambo  ya  Al-\\nShabaab, kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa ajira. \\n\\nKwa hivyo, namuomba Rais pia atufungulie viwanda. Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) \\nilikufa  Mombasa,  lakini  inafanya  kazi  sehemu  zingine.  Haijafufuliwa  Mombasa.  Tuangalie \\nviwanda vya korosho, miwa na Kenya Bixa. Vyote vifunguliwe ili wakaazi wa Mombasa na \\nPwani nzima waweze kupata ajira na kuuza rasilimali zao. \\n\\nNataka  kuzungumzia  mambo  ya  afya.  Sote  tunaelewa  kuwa  National  Hospital \\nInsurance Fund (NHIF) ililetwa ili kuboresha na kufanya wepesi wa watu kupata huduma za \\nafya. Lakini, wengi wakienda kwenye hospitali, wanaambiwa kuwa NHIF inagharamia pesa \\nya  kitanda  na  hakuna  dawa  na  huduma  zingine  ambazo  wanafanyiwa.  Wazee  wengi \\nwamelalamika sana. Kwa hivyo, Serikali iangalie hali katika NHIF, ili tuweze kupata huduma \\nambayo inatibu maradhi mengi mazito.  \\n\\nKisha  nikiangalia  mgao  wetu  wa  National  Government  Affirmative  Action  Fund \\n(NGAAF) kama akina mama wa kaunti 47, mgao wetu uko chini sana ukilinganisha na kuwa \\ntunafanya siasa kaunti nzima. Ndio maana wengi hawarudi Bungeni. Kwa hivyo, namuomba \\nRais,  aangalie  hilo  kila  atakapoangalia  National  Government  Constituencies  Development \\nFund  (NG-CDF)  na  yale  mengine  ya  kaunti.  Pia,  sisi  wanawake  katika  The  National \\nGovernment Affirmative Action Fund (NGAF), namuomba aangalie hali zetu ili tupate mgao \\nambao utatusaidia.  \\nNikirudi  upande  wa  migration,  watoto  wetu  wa  Pwani  na  hasa  Waislamu \\n \\nwanahangaishwa sana katika kila pembe. Kupata kitambulisho cha Kenya imekuwa ni donda \\nndugu. Wanaulizwa mpaka birth certificate za vilembwe na vilembwekeza wakati ambapo wao \\nni watoto waliozaliwa Kenya. Wamezaliwa katika hospitali zetu na wanajulikana. Ningeomba \\nRais  aangalie  hilo  hasa  kuhusu  sisi  Waislamu  ili  tusipate  matatizo  tunapotafuta  pasipoti  na \\nvitambulisho.  \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, Mheshimiwa. Let us have the Member for Kitutu Masaba. \\n \\n \\nHon. Clive Gisairo (Kitutu Masaba, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I congratulate \\nyou on your election as Speaker of this House. I thank the people of Kitutu Masaba for electing \\nme  to  be  their  representative  in  this  13th  Parliament.  Hon.  Speaker,  I  will  go  straight  to  the \\nPresident’s Speech. I will look into the matters that mainly touch on my people. \\n\\nWith  regard  to  agriculture,  the  President  and  the  new  administration  has  released \\ncheaper  fertilizers  than  the  ones  that  have  been  availed  in  previous  months.  This,  however, \\ndoes not favour all citizens of this country because not every farmer grows crops. Personally, \\nI am a poultry keeper. The cost of feeds in this country is simply unaffordable. It is no longer \\ncheap  to  keep  any  animal.  Therefore,  we  get  very  stiff  competition  from  imported  goods, \\nespecially  animal  products.  We  urge  the  new  administration  to  consider  animal  feeds  while \\nlooking at agricultural inputs. \\n \\nWhen we talk about infrastructure in this country, there is no balance. Infrastructure \\ndoes not only relate to Nairobi and the surrounding environs. I come from a constituency where \\nroad  coverage  is  at  a  dismal  level.  We  urge  this  new  Government  to  ensure  that  there  is  a \\nbalance and that, all the citizens and the people of Kitutu Masaba have their roads done and \\nfeel part of this nation. For example, we have two contracts in my constituency - the RWC586, \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

That contract also \\ncovers  Gekano-Girango-Moturumesi  and  Manga-Motemumwamu.  You  will  be  surprised  to \\nknow that with 67 per cent of the time covered for that contract, only five per cent of the work \\nhas  been  done  and  yet,  my  people  are  suffering  and  nobody  addresses  this  issue.  We  have \\nanother contract, RWC485, Kemera-Kiendege-Gachuba-Keumbu. This contract is 37 months \\nbehind schedule.

We  need  to  put  more  effort  and  resources  into  Technical  and  Vocational \\nEducation Training (TVET) colleges and polytechnics so that our youths can have a place to \\nlearn handicraft and any other skills that can help them be of importance to this country. As we \\nhave a country of hustlers led by the chief hustler himself, we need to get more skills for our \\nyouths so that they can fit in the society.  \\nOn the Uwezo Fund and the Hustler Fund, these should be looked into so that they are \\n \\ncomplemented or merged. We do not need too many funds and duplications that end up not \\nserving the intended goal.  \\n \\nOn the NSSF, whoever put that paragraph in the President’s Speech should be called to \\norder. It was a very casual statement whereby it was said it is 200 x 12 x 30 and yet, NSSF is \\na Fund where trustees are earning millions of shillings which they are meant to invest for the \\npeople.

Speaker: Thank you, Hon. Member. Member for Bura. \\nHon.  Yakub  Adow  (Bura,  UPIA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker,  for  giving  me  this \\n\\nI thank the people of my constituency. I look forward to serving you in the next five \\n\\nI take this earliest opportunity to thank God almighty for giving me the opportunity to \\nrepresent the great people of Bura Constituency in this 13th Parliament. Secondly, I thank my \\nparents, my family and my dear wife who really prayed for me and supported me throughout \\nthis journey. Thirdly, I thank my employers; the great people of Bura Constituency, who have \\nshown confidence in me by giving me a landslide win against all other opponents. My great \\npeople  of  Bura  Constituency,  I  really  assure  you  that  I  will  serve  you  with  purpose  and \\ndedication. I will ensure that you get what  you intended to  get when  you elected me to this \\naugust  House.  I  specifically  thank  my  teams  in  Bangale  Ward,  Madogo  Ward,  Sala  Ward, \\nChewele Ward and Hirimani Ward for the dedication they had.  \\n \\nFast forward, indeed, it is a dream comes true for me to be contributing today in this \\naugust House. My election to this august House is a true testament that no human is limited \\nand all dreams are valid. If you dream and pursue your dreams with dedication and purpose, \\nyou will achieve. My employers have sent me here to use all avenues and premiums available \\nto air their concerns and grievances.   \\n \\nBecause  I  have  only  five  minutes,  let  me  rush  through  the  challenges  within  my \\nconstituency. The biggest challenge is the drought that is facing all the arid and semi-arid lands. \\nIn Bangale Ward today, a 20-litre jerrycan of water goes for Kshs80. If you quickly do your \\nmaths, this vital commodity is Kshs4 per litre. We do water trucking from as far as Garissa that \\nis 90 kilometres away from Bangale Ward. Today, I am happy to report that I got a well-wisher \\nwho helped me with a 35,000-litre capacity water truck. This will be of great help to the people \\nof Bangale Ward and Sale Ward which are the worst hit areas. I urge the Government, through \\nthe Ministry of Water, to come in handy and help alleviate this problem. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

As  we  know,  this  is  a  very  important \\n \\ndocument. There is a student who secured a scholarship to pursue further studies in Turkey but \\nis unable to travel because of lack of that vital document. \\n\\nLastly,  I  want  to  highlight  the  issue  of  education.  We  have  13  secondary  schools  in \\nBura Constituency - 10 public schools and three private ones. The sorry state of affairs is that \\nin the last Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination, the best school got \\na mean grade of D (plain), and this is a private school.   \\n\\nHon. Speaker, because of time,  I  wish to  request the new administration  to  help  my \\nconstituency and to help farmers in my constituency so that, at least, we can help with food \\nsecurity. That is in line with the agenda of the Government. \\n\\nThank you. \\nHon. Speaker:  Thank you. Women Representative for Tharaka Nithi.  Give her the \\n\\nmicrophone. \\n\\nHon.  Susan  Ngugi  (Tharaka  Nithi  CWR,  TSP):  Thank  you  Hon.  Speaker.  I  am \\ndelighted as I make my maiden speech and debate a little about the Presidential Speech that \\nwas made about two weeks ago.  I wish to congratulate you for having been elected Speaker in \\nthis 13th Parliament. \\n\\nIt is a great honour as I stand in this House as the second woman representative or rather \\nthe Member of Parliament (MP) for Tharaka Nithi County.  I first wish to thank the people of \\nTharaka Nithi County for bestowing on me strength to lead them in the affirmative action.  It \\nwas not easy being lifted from a Member of County Assembly (MCA) to an MP; being lifted \\nfrom a County Assembly to a National Parliament; and, winning against all the strides and tides \\nhaving been elected in a non-dominating party.  I also wish to thank my party leader of The \\nService Party (TSP) whom I deputise, Hon. Mwangi Kiunjuri, for holding my hand and helping \\nme clinch the victory. \\n\\nI am here to affirm to the people of Tharaka Nithi County that I have not come here to \\nmake a career, but to make a difference in their lives. I have not come here to act in my own \\ninterest, but the interest of the people of Tharaka Nithi County. I wish to affirm to them that I \\nwill really hold hands with the MPs; that is, MP for Tharaka Hon. George Gitonga Murugara, \\nMP for Maara Hon. Kareke Mbiuki and MP for Chuka/Igambang’ombe Hon. Patrick Munene, \\nto  ensure  that  we  promote  the  issues  of  Tharaka  Nithi  County,  especially  the  issues  of  the \\naffirmative action. \\n\\nI  know  Tharaka  Nithi  County  has  really  been  marginalised  and  has  faced  a  lot  of \\nhistorical injustices, but with the leadership of Kenya Kwanza Alliance under his Excellency \\nWilliam Samoei Ruto, we are assured that all these issues are going to be addressed.  This has \\nreally been demonstrated by the fact  that our President has gone to  the most remote part of \\nTharaka Nithi County, Tharaka Constituency, and to the most remote part of Tharaka, Irunduni \\nvillage, where he has nominated a Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National \\nGovernment, Prof. Kithure Kindiki.  I wish to congratulate him and pray that this House will \\nvery  soon  move  ahead  and  confirm  Prof.  Kithure  Kindiki  as  the  Cabinet  Secretary.  Hon. \\nSpeaker, we are  really hopeful that it is  just a matter of time that someone from  the soil of \\nTharaka Nithi County is going to rule this country.   \\n\\nI cannot end my maiden speech without commending my predecessor, Hon. Beatrice \\nNkatha, for having been elected twice  as Women Representative for Tharaka Nithi County.  \\nUnited Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance are well aware of \\nthe role that Hon. Nkatha played in spearheading the campaigns for UDA party.  In this regard, \\nI pray that UDA and Kenya Kwanza Alliance will recognize the efforts by Hon. Nkatha. I also \\nwish her well in all her endeavours. \\n\\nAs  pertains  the  President's  Speech,  it  was  brief  and  to  the  point.  The  Speech  has \\nreassured us that we are not to tear apart institutions but to nourish them; and that, we are to \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wish to end it with a note: That the future of this nation does not belong \\nto the faint-hearted, but to the brave. \\n\\nI thank you Hon. Speaker and this House.  \\nHon.

Spika  kwa  kunipatia  fursa  hii \\nnitoe maoni yangu.  Kwanza nashukuru Mwenyezi Mungu kwa umbali ambao amenifikisha. \\nLeo niko hapa katika Bunge letu tukufu.  Naomba nichukue fursa hii ya kipekee kuwashukuru \\nwakaazi wote wa eneo bunge la Rabai kwa kusimama nami. Siku ya kupiga kura walijitokeza \\nkwa wingi kunichagua niwe mtumishi wao.   \\n\\nNataka kuchukua fursa hii kupongeza timu yote ya Kenga Mupe a.k.a Apewe, kutoka \\nMwawesa Ward, Ruruma, Kambe/Ribe na Rabai Kisurutini. Kwa hakika, walifanya kazi  ya \\nmaana  tena  nzuri.  Mimi  kama  mtumishi  wao,  Mhe.  Anthony  Kenga  Mupe,  nawahakikishia \\nwakaazi  wote  wa  Rabai  kuwa  nitawatumikia  pasipo  ubaguzi  na  pasipo  kuangalia  yule \\naliyenipigia kura na yule ambaye hakunipigia kura. \\n\\nMhe. Spika, kuhusu Hotuba ya Rais, ilikuwa safi sana, fupi, nzuri, na ya kuaminika.  \\nKwa  sababu  katika  Hotuba  hiyo,  alizungumzia  suala  la  maji.  Kama  tunavyojua,  Katiba  Ya \\nKenya katika Ibara 43(1)(d), inamhakikishia kila mtu haki ya kupata maji safi, salama na ya \\nkutosha. Kwa hivyo, nampongeza sana Mhe. Rais kwa hotuba yake iliyoangazia suala la maji.  \\nNikiwa Mbunge wa Rabai, najua tatizo kubwa sana ni ukosefu wa maji. Kwa hivyo, kupitia \\nHotuba ya Mhe. Rais, sekta ya umma na ya kibinafsi zitasambaza maji kwa Wakenya wote.  \\nNapongeza sana Hotuba ya Mhe. Rais.   \\n\\nPia katika Hotuba ya Mhe. Rais, alizungumzia Hustler’s Fund.  Kupitia Hustler’s Fund, \\nvijana wetu watapata nafasi ya kufanya biashara ndogo ndogo. Mama mboga, mama fagio na \\nmama kuuza nazi kutoka Rabai atapata nafasi nzuri ya kujiinua katika maisha.  Kwa hivyo, \\nnapongeza kikamilifu Hotuba ya Mhe. Rais na ninaiunga mkono kwa sababu imezungumzia \\nzile shida za mtu wa chini hususan kutoka Rabai Sub County. \\n\\nNikimalizia, nakushuru Mhe. Spika. Wewe ni kiongozi wa chama cha FORD Kenya na \\nalama yako ni Simba. Ingawa hivyo, juzi wakati ulipokuwa unatoa mwongozo na uamuzi humu \\nBungeni kuhusu ni nani wengi katika Bunge hili, kwa hakika ulisimama imara kama simba na \\nkuamua kwamba Kenya Kwanza ndiyo ina wabunge wengi katika Bunge hili. Ahsante sana \\nMheshimiwa Spika. Nakupongeza wewe na Naibu wako. Mungu aibariki Kenya. \\n \\nHon. Speaker: Ahsante Mheshimiwa. Anayefuata ni Mbunge wa Aldai.  \\n \\nHon. Marianne Kitany (Aldai, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Speaker for giving me this \\nopportunity  to  make  my  maiden  speech.  I  promise  to  make  it  short  and  sweet,  just  like  the \\nPresident’s Speech.  \\n\\nFirst, let me congratulate you and the Hon. Deputy Speaker for your election to those \\npositions in this House. Let me also congratulate the President for his election. Already, within \\nthe  30  days,  he  has  done  so  much.  Hon.  Mbadi  mentioned  that  the  President  has  not  done \\nanything in the 30 days, but we know that the President has done so much. For instance, the \\nSafaricom Fuliza interest rate has been reduced by 40 per cent. That is no mean feat.  It has \\ngone a long way in helping the Kenyan mwananchi to get credit at a cheaper rate. We also have \\nseen him engage in many international activities in which he is getting many accolades and \\nbeing saluted by leaders, including the President of the United States of America. So, who are \\nwe not to appreciate the work that he has done? \\n \\nthe Opposition.  \\n \\n\\nThe work that he has done in 30 days is very meaningful, but it is being undermined by \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Mosses Wetang’ula ) left the Chair] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

(Ms.) Boss Shollei ) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nHe is trying to sort out the problems and messes that were created in the last 10 years. He has \\nfive years to deliver and we are sure that he will deliver. To the people of Aldai, I would like \\nthank you very much for having faith in me and electing me. You have done your bit and mine \\nis to deliver.  \\n \\nI have a four-point agenda for the people of Aldai. The first one is road infrastructure. \\nIn  the  10  years  that  the  annuity  program  was  put  in  place,  Aldai  Constituency  got  zero \\nkilometres of tarmac road. I would like to use the opportunity I have in this House to ensure \\nthat Aldai gets, at least, some tarmacked roads in the next five years. \\n\\nThe second agenda item is electricity. Many homes still lack electricity. I think we have \\n\\n30 per cent connectivity in Aldai. We hope to have many more homes getting connected.  \\n\\nThe third agenda item is water. I am happy that the President, in his Speech, mentioned \\nthat water projects will be done on the basis of Public Private Partnership (PPP). So, we will \\nget water to our homesteads.  \\n\\nFinally, it is  on education. We have a big shortage of teachers in  various schools in \\nAldai and, hence, the poor performance in schools. We hope that the Ministry of Education \\nwill send in more teachers. Kenya Kwanza promised to employ 160,000 teachers in the first \\nand  second  year  each.  We  hope  that  out  of  those  teachers,  majority  of  them  will  go  to  our \\nschools to improve teaching standards. \\n \\nOn NG-CDF, we are happy that the President recognises that it has done a lot in our \\nconstituencies.  I  will  ensure  that  the  NG-CDF  is  used  to  improve  the  infrastructure  in  our \\nschools. More than 25 schools in my constituency are still mud-walled in this day and age. I \\nhope to ensure that by the time I am done with my term; there will be no mud-walled schools \\nin Aldai Constituency. I will give priority to the 25 schools that are still mud-walled. The NG-\\nCDF has been very successful. We hope that other Government development projects will be \\nchannelled through the same framework as the NG-CDF. Just like the way Kenya Rural Roads \\nAuthority (KeRRA) has been functioning, we hope that other Government entities will do their \\nprojects in constituencies so that each and every constituency gets a pie of  the development \\nprojects. There is a school in my constituency that went on strike, but  I hope that it will be \\nsorted out. \\n\\nFinally, on the issue of Competency Based Curriculum (CBC), we want to …    \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Kesses. \\n \\nHon. Julius Rutto (Kesses, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. Let me also take \\nthis opportunity to join my colleagues to congratulate you and Hon. Speaker for being given \\nthe opportunity to serve this Honourable House. I thank my constituents of Kesses that saw an \\nopportunity to have me sit in this House and prosecute matters that touch on their livelihoods. \\nI believe that all of you know that whenever you mention Kesses, of course, something comes \\nto your mind. It was not that simple, but I thank God that I made it to this House. \\n\\nThe President’s Speech is one that was delivered in a very short time and yet, it carries \\n\\nweighty matters that touch on Kenyans. The President said and I quote: \\n\\n “I have news, and not very good news!”  \\n\\nIndeed, this was a Speech that was made with openness, without fear and without hiding \\nany issues that touch on Kenyans’ lives. It is a matter of fact that we must admit even in this \\nHouse; that Kenyans are facing very difficult times now. The cost of living is on the higher \\nside. The debts that have been soiling our Kenyan economy are a reality. This Speech brings \\nall  our  minds  together  to  appreciate  that  we  have  a  big  role  in  this  House  to  support  the \\nGovernment in transforming our economic lives of our people, so as to have a Kenya that we \\ndreamt  to  have.  Kenyans  at  the  lower  base  shall  enjoy  the  dream  of  being  citizens  of  this \\ncountry. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, on the aspect of healthcare, I want to confirm to this House that \\n \\nwe have and are facing a lot of challenges as Kenyans right now. Over the weekend, I managed \\nto attend two different funerals where families had lost their loved ones as a result of cancer, \\nwhich is now ravaging families in the countryside. It is, indeed, an issue that we need to look \\ninto in this House. Do we need to legislate laws that are going to enable the National Health \\nInsurance Fund (NHIF) to specifically take care of all those illnesses, especially the terminals \\nones?  This  is  because,  whenever  they  affect  our  families,  they  bring  down  our  economic \\nabilities.  \\n \\nSecondly, it is about enabling the bottom-up economic model, which the President used \\nas his campaign tool. On the aspect of education, I come from a county that entirely depends \\non  education  and  agriculture.  In  the  higher  education  sector,  there  have  lately  been  a  many \\ncases where our universities are ageing and collapsing. I am privileged to have Moi University \\nin my constituency. Right now, it requires serious attention from the national Government to \\nrevolutionise and re-organize it so that it can retain its glory of producing the human capital we \\nrequire.  \\n \\nOn the aspect of Hustler Fund in Paragraph 28, I want to appreciate the President for \\nrecognising that we have a working nation and that Kenyans are very resilient. The challenges \\nwe  are  facing  at  the  moment  is  access  to  cheap  capital  and  funding  that  can  fund  their \\ninnovation. This is something we need to put together as a House of legislation and support the \\nPresident.  I  believe  that  the  incoming  Cabinet  Secretary,  Hon.  Chelugui,  will  consider  this \\nmatter because Paragraph 28 is talking about the use of technology that will ensure that fund \\nis  managed well.  I want  to  believe  that he is going to  consider giving an opportunity to  the \\nyouth of this nation, especially those who can innovate in technology, to be the example of \\nappreciating the bottom-up economic model. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, lastly, I wish to appreciate the President for nominating to the Cabinet \\nsome Hon. Members of Parliament who have sat in this House before. These are the people \\nwho resonate well with people on ground and understand where the real issues are. I wish to \\ncongratulate them and tell them that time is on their side to prove that; indeed, we can articulate \\nand prosecute matters that target the lives of Kenyans.  \\n\\nThank you and may God bless you. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Karachuonyo. \\nHon. Adipo Okuome (Karachuonyo, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I am \\nhappy for this opportunity. I have really waited. When I spoke to the Hon. Speaker, he told me \\nto wait, which I have done. I wish to congratulate you and the Hon. Speaker for having been \\nelected to your positions. I wish to thank my constituents, the Karachuonyo people, for electing \\nme the second time to the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nI want to refer to the President’s Speech, and, in particular, on the cost of living. When \\nhe  removed  the  subsidy  on  fuel,  it  really  meant  that  the  cost  of  living  had  to  go  up.  As  we \\nspeak,  the  cost  of  living  has  gone  up  quite  high  and  the  fuel  is  reaching  a  level  of \\nunaffordability. It is the policy on subsidy production rather than consumption which may not \\nwork for Kenyans. For example, if you take the fuel which is imported, the production part is \\ndone in a country outside Kenya and, therefore, the policy of subsidising productivity cannot \\napply.  That  is  because  we  cannot  afford  to  give  subsidy  to  a  country  outside  ours.  This  is \\nsomething that should be considered because when fuel price go up, it gives rise to prices of \\nalmost every commodity.  \\n\\nThe one thing that I think the President ought to have mentioned - but he very much \\navoided  it  -  is  corruption.  Much  of  our  money  goes  there.  When  the  President  says  that  he \\nwants to reduce the budget of Kshs3.3 trillion by Kshs0.3 trillion, he is trying to make ends \\nmeet. Reduction of a budget does not help anything because it depends on what the budget was \\nmeant to do. If you reduce it by Kshs300 billion, that money was supposed to do something for \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

How is he going to fund that deficit? This is something that needs to be considered. \\nOtherwise, we are going to have a problem. Maybe, he should have gained that Kshs300 billion \\nby reducing corruption at a much higher figure than the figure that he wants to reduce with. \\n\\nThe President visited my own county and I thank him very much for that. Some people \\nhave criticized us, we the elected leaders, that we did not join the President during his visit. Let \\nme say it here and now that the criticism is not justified at all. We did not join the President \\nbecause we did not even know that he was going to Homa Bay County. Therefore, saying that \\nwe avoided being with him there is just trying to criticize us for nothing. I want this to go on \\nrecord because that is a very important thing. We do not want a negative reflection where we \\nare not concerned. Of course, the President has a right to visit any place, anywhere at his own \\ntime either in the company of politicians or alone. He exercised his right. Why bring us into \\nthat problem that we did not want to be with him? No! That was not right. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, my time is over. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. I am \\n\\nhappy for it. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Moyale. Proceed. \\nHon. (Prof.)  Guyo  Jaldesa  (Moyale, UPIA): Thank  you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for \\ngiving  me  this  opportunity.  As  everybody  else  is  doing,  may  I  also  take  my  chance  to \\ncongratulate you and the Hon. Speaker for your election to lead this House. I also thank the \\ngreat people of Moyale for giving me an opportunity to serve them in this august House. I also \\nthank  the  people  of  Kenya  for  accepting  to  remain  cohesive  and  peaceful  during  the \\nuncomfortable election period.  \\n\\nAs the President said, the election was intensively contested and both sides had almost \\nequal numbers. There is another 8 million people who did not vote. If they had voted, we do \\nnot  know  which  side  they  would  have  voted  for.  However,  the  people  of  Kenya  remained \\nobedient and loyal to the law. Even the order of the leadership in this House was disputed and \\nsomehow settled in a very acrimonious way. There was no clear winner and that is why there \\nwas that contest. Africans like to refer to leadership as being God-given, and it is a choice. As \\nleaders in this House, inside and outside here, we need to embrace humanity and try to bring \\nthe nation together. \\n\\nOn the President’s Speech, I am happy that the President talked about Universal Health \\nCoverage (UHC). This is a good thing, but I am of the opinion that we need to find out how to \\nmake  National  Health  Insurance  Fund  (NHIF)  cover  a  universal  thing  that  every  Kenyan  is \\nentitled to. Our neighbour, Rwanda, has 98 per cent NHIF coverage. There is no reason we \\ncannot do it. \\n\\nThere is also need for us to achieve that universal coverage to restructure the Ministry \\nof Health. The Health Ministry was devolved, but that devolution has actually disadvantaged \\nareas that were already disadvantaged. There is no reason why a doctor should not be moved \\nfrom Kisumu to work in Garissa and vice versa. This business of putting people in counties \\nactually restricts the movement of people and deployment of staff and, therefore, disadvantages \\nareas which are already disadvantaged. It is my view that health facilities at the level of 4, 5 \\nand 6 should be put under the national Government and levels 3 and 2 put under the county \\ngovernments. \\n\\nPeople  said  the  President  gave  a  short  Speech.  It  was  not  short!  It  was  actually  33 \\nminutes of oral presentation. Somebody can cover a wide area at that time. I listened carefully \\nto the issues of drought and insecurity in the country. Most Members have contributed to the \\nissue of insecurity. Just  a few days before the Address  by  His Excellency  the President,  11 \\npolice officers were killed in Turkana. Last week, a police officer was killed. The Government \\nof Kenya should take positive action to ensure that those tribal clashes, clashes between the \\npolice and clan clashes come to an end. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

We need to take positive steps to make sure that \\nour lives are protected from recurring droughts. We should take measures to make sure that \\nothers do not die unnecessarily from the effects of drought every season.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Murang’a County. \\nHon. Betty Maina (Murang’a CWR, UDA)]: Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. My \\nname is Betty Njeri Maina. I wish to first thank the Almighty God for giving me an opportunity \\nto be elected as a Member of Parliament for Murang’a County. I also wish to thank the people \\nof  Murang’a  County  for  electing  me  overwhelmingly,  being  a  youth  and  a  lady.  I  wish  to \\ncongratulate the Hon. Speaker for having been elected as the Speaker of this 13th Parliament. I \\nalso wish to congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for being elected as Deputy Speaker, \\nbeing a female Deputy Speaker from the popular caucus of the Women Representatives that \\nused to be unpopular and were referred to as “flower girls”. It shows that this House is coming \\nof age and we are moving forward. I wish to congratulate the President for having nominated \\nHon.  Alice  Wahome  to  be  the  Cabinet  Secretary  in  the  Ministry  of  Water,  Sanitation  and \\nIrrigation. She is  from Murang’a County and  I  wish to  confirm  to the nation that Murang’a \\nCounty is a hub for beautiful and brilliant women. We are sure that given the opportunity by \\nthis House, she will take water and sanitation matters to the next level.  \\n\\nI  wish  to  comment  on  the  President's  Speech.  Firstly,  70  per  cent  of  the  people  of \\nMurang’a County depend on agriculture. When we unlock agriculture, we are going to unlock \\nthe potential and the economy of the people of Murang’a County. I wish to pick a few points \\nthat the President talked about. He talked of reducing the cost of production on animal feeds \\nand farm inputs. I will not emphasise agricultural issues because Members have commented \\non them.  \\n\\nI wish to go straight to the hustler’s fund. As we talk about the hustler’s fund, I wish to \\nappreciate the existence of other funds, including the Women Enterprise Development Fund, \\nthe Youth Enterprise Development Fund and the Uwezo Fund. People may not have felt the \\nimpact  of those funds previously but,  if those funds are distributed in  the right  manner, our \\npeople are going to feel their positive effects. \\n\\nWe have hustlers and young women in this nation who are suffering. They are going to \\nother countries in search for greener pastures, especially our ladies who go to work in countries \\nlike Saudi Arabia. If we empower those people, we are going to mitigate some of those issues. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, if we continue empowering the hustlers, we are going to mitigate \\nthe issues of migration. Our young ladies are migrating from Kenya to other nations and  are \\nbeing misused and being made captives.  \\n\\nAs I summarise, I wish to go back to the issue of agriculture. If we work on agriculture, \\nwe are going to mitigate rural-urban migration and promote urban-rural migration. By doing \\nthis, we are going to create employment. We are also going to deal with the issue of housing \\nand this will eradicate slums and congestion in our cities. \\n\\nI am looking forward to working in this Parliament, to be mentored, to be guided and \\n\\nto take the people of Murang’a County to the next level. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: That was brief, concise and good. Member for Marakwet. \\nHon. Timothy Kipchumba (Marakwet West, Independent): Thank you, Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker. My name is Kipchumba, the Member of Parliament for Marakwet West. Thank you \\nfor giving me this opportunity to make these remarks.  \\n\\nOne, I wish to thank the people of Marakwet West for electing me. I was elected under \\nextremely exceptional circumstances. I allegedly lost the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) \\nnomination and I went back to the ballot as an independent candidate. The people of Marakwet \\nWest  elected  me  overwhelmingly  through  the  independent  ticket.  I  want  to  thank  them  so \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I wish to  thank the people of Arror Ward, Kapsowar Ward, Moiben Kuserwo Ward, \\nLelan Ward, Cherangany/Chebororwa Ward and the people of Sengwer Ward for electing me \\nto this House. I came to this House when I was very young. I came to this House in the year \\n1996 when I was in Class IV in Kamasat Primary School. When I came at that time, it painted \\na picture and I told myself that one day, I will be in this House. I thank God because, indeed, \\ntoday, I am in this House. \\n\\n Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  in  so  far  as  the  Presidential  Address  is  concerned,  this  time \\n\\naround, we have an exceptional President. \\n\\nIf  you  read  the  book,  “Man  of  The  People”  by  Chinua  Achebe,  there  is  a  character \\nknown as Chief Nanga, who was described as a ‘man of the people.’ I think His Excellency the \\nPresident fits  that definition. He is  truly a man of the people.  I believe that  when he settles \\ndown to work, we shall have a President of the people, by the people for the people.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, what touched me in the President’s Speech was his commitment \\nto the rule of law. For me, that is a cardinal principle that this country must be ruled upon. We \\nmust be a country that abides by the rule of law. I want to commend him because the first thing \\nhe did was to appoint the six judges who were held in abeyance by the other regime. I think \\nthat was a hallmark of obedience to the rule of law. \\n\\nThe President also committed that he would implement bottom-up scaling of justice. I \\ncome from  a constituency where we have one court  of law serving four constituencies. The \\ncourt is  located in  Iten.  In Marakwet West,  we have no court, Marakwet  East  has no court. \\nKeiyo North and Keiyo South are only served by one court in Iten. Hon. Deputy Speaker, going \\nforward, I believe that we shall have many courts at the local level. \\n\\nI also want to comment on an issue that the President said, that he would implore upon \\nthis House to amend the Standing Orders so that the Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) appear on the \\nFloor of the House so that they can be asked Questions. I am inclined to the school of thought \\nthat, as per the current constitutional dispensation, the CSs may not appear on the Floor of this \\nHouse because the architecture of our Constitution is that one of a presidential system. That \\nwill  call  for  a  re-look  into  our  constitutional  architecture  so  that  the  CSs  can  appear  on  the \\nFloor of this House. \\n\\nOn the issue of National Government - Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF), I \\npersonally think that without NG-CDF, there is nothing much that the Members of the National \\nAssembly can achieve. Since we have the goodwill of the President, it will be good if the same \\nis  entrenched  in  the  Constitution.  Just  like  other  funds,  CDF  should  be  entrenched  in  the \\nConstitution. \\n\\nOn  security  matters,  he  never  touched  on  it.  But  I  have  confidence  that  the  security \\n\\nalong Kerio Valley Belt shall be dealt with accordingly by this Government. \\n\\nFinally,  I  want  to  thank  the  President  for  appointing  our  Senator,  Kipchumba \\nMurkomen, to be the CS for the Ministry of Roads, Transport and Infrastructure. Thank you so \\nmuch, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Nominated Member from Garissa, Hon. Harun. \\nHon.  Umulkher  Harun  (Nominated,  ODM):  Thank  you,  so  much,  Hon.  Deputy \\nSpeaker, for giving me this opportunity. My name is Hon. Umulkher Harun and it is with great \\nhonour and responsibility that I am able to serve in this 13th Parliament. I appreciate my party, \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM),  for  believing  in  my  capacity  and  allowing  me  to \\nrepresent the interests of young people in this country. I also want to congratulate all Members \\nwho were elected and nominated from different political parties and wish them well as they \\ndischarge their mandate.  \\n\\nPresident William Samoei Ruto in his inaugural session in this House outlined various \\nissues  which  his  administration  would  wish  to  undertake.  One  fundamental  issue  His \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 44 \\n\\nExcellency touched on is immediate consideration of the current drought afflicting our people \\nin the northern parts of our country.  \\n\\nI urge the President to work closely with the Pastoralist Parliamentary Group (PPG) so \\nas to address the immediate needs as well as stable long-term solutions. Arid and Semi-Arid \\nLands (ASAL) regions make up 89 per cent of land cover in this country. I would like to let \\nthe House know that the best lemons and watermelons come from Garissa County and northern \\nKenya at large.  \\n\\nOn the hustlers’ fund, it is my belief that the President will actualise his pledge to the \\nyouth who I represent in this House. I urge him to ensure the fund is immediately available to \\nthis Kenyans on affordable interest rates, so, they can either expand or start their businesses. \\nOn Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), a country like Kenya is not having food shortage \\nbecause it cannot produce enough. The food shortage is largely because we are not producing \\nfor subsistence use but for international markets whose economic policy does not favour the \\nproducers especially in the third world countries.  \\n\\nKenya  does  not  need  GMOs  to  tackle  food  security.  What  we  need  are  policies  and \\nuniversally  available  food  preservation  methods.  We  lose  a  lot  of  food  to  wastage  due  to \\nrejection by international exporters.  Using the drought as a reason to allow GMOs in Kenya \\nwithout ensuring all the safeguards are in place is wrong. For example, Kenya has not ratified \\nthe Nagoya – Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol to Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  \\n\\nThe  protocol  provides  international  rules  and  procedures  in  the  field  of  liability  and \\nredress relating to living modified organisms. The protocol requires that response measures are \\ntaken in the event of damages resulting from the living modified organisms or where there is \\nsufficient likelihood that damage will result if timely response measures are not taken.  \\n\\nMy question then is: How do we open ourselves to this biotechnology without proper \\nprotection on measures in the name of food security? Instead, why not build dams and dispatch \\nirrigation  technologies  to  address  the  food  security  challenge?  We  should  invest  in  organic \\nfoods instead of going to GMOs. We have plenty of arable land that if irrigated, we can feed \\nourselves and export food. It is interesting to note that when North Eastern Province counties \\nare short of food, farmers in Molo are feeding fresh produce to their animals due to lack of \\nmarket.  \\n\\nGMOs  will  have  adverse  effect  on  organic  farming.  My  question  is:  Has  the \\nGovernment  consulted  the  public?  Was  there  any  form  of  public  participation  before  this \\ndecision  was  made?  How  can  the  Government  arbitrarily  make  such  decisions  while  being \\nsubservient to foreign interest? The decision has regional implications. For example, Tanzania \\nhas already braced itself for the possibility of our GMOs finding their way in the country. This \\nwill  affect  the  harmony  of  freedom  between  neighbouring  states  of  the  East  African \\nCommunity (EAC).  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity.  I  look  forward  to \\n\\nrepresenting the interests of young people in this House. Thank you very much. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Next is the Member for Trans Nzoia County. Is she \\n\\nhere? Okay proceed.  \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Lilian Siyoi (Trans Nzoia, CWR, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nfor giving me this chance to  represent  the people of Trans Nzoia. My name is  Lilian Siyoi, \\nCounty Women Representative (CWR) for Trans Nzoia County.  \\n\\nI would like to thank the Almighty God for granting me this chance to be here today. \\nMy special thanks go to the people of Trans Nzoia County, men and women, for having elected \\nme without looking at tribal or party affiliations. I am one of the people who were elected on \\nthe United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket. Yet, we had other candidates elected on other \\ntickets. I appreciate the people of Trans Nzoia. Thank you, so much. I promise to serve you \\nwith diligence and fairness. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, I also want to congratulate you for being elected as our Deputy \\nSpeaker. As women of Trans Nzoia and of this nation at large, we are so much proud of you \\nand congratulations to you again.   \\n\\nI want to go direct to the President’s Speech which he delivered in this House when he \\nwas here. He talked about the hustlers’ fund. I want to inform this House that the main concern \\nwe have in this country is access to credit. Our country has been having this problem for so \\nlong. It is important that our President thought it right to have the fund accessible to the people \\nwho cannot afford services like bank loans so that they can improve their lives.  \\n\\nI want to thank my party leader for mentoring, trusting and giving me a ticket which I \\nhad to deliver. Therefore, today, I am here representing the people of Trans Nzoia. I also wish \\nto urge the men in the House, as we deliberate on the amounts to be given to the hustlers’ fund, \\nwe should also deliberate on the amounts given to women representatives through the National \\nGovernment Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF).  \\n\\nThe amount we have been given is very little, bearing in mind that we are representing \\nthe women, youth and people living with disability. They are most vulnerable in our country \\nand highly populous. I urge you as we discuss on the disbursement of funds to the hustlers’ \\nfund, let us increase funds given to NGAAF so we can give the women, youth and people living \\nwith  disability  in  this  country  services  that  will  serve  them  well.  I  know  if  we  empower  a \\nwoman, we will have empowered the whole community.  \\n\\nThank you, so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this chance.   \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Loima. \\nHon. Protus Akujah (Loima, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for allowing \\nme to add my voice to the President’s Speech. For the record, my name is Hon. Protus Akujah, \\nMember  of  Parliament  for  Loima  Constituency  in  Turkana  County.  Before  I  make  my \\ncomments  on  the  President’s  Speech,  allow  me  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  great \\npeople of Loima Constituency for recognising my commitment to work for them. Therefore, \\nthey have given me another chance to serve them and I do not take it for granted.  \\n\\nAccording  to  me,  the  President’s  Speech  was  concise  and  elaborate.  However,  I  am \\nquick to mention that I noted with utmost concern that he did not address the issue of insecurity \\nas mentioned by a Member from Baringo County.   \\n\\nI  know  there  could  be  some  relative  peace  in  some  parts  of  this  country.  But \\noutstandingly, the external aggression Kenyans continue to face from Uganda, South Sudan \\nand Ethiopia to the people of Turkana County is very loud. The Kenya Government has been \\nsilent  on  the  daily  killing  of  Turkana  pastoralists  in  Lokichogio,  Lotere,  Lorugum,  Loyoro, \\nKibish  and  Todonyang,  leave  alone  the  internal  insecurity  within  our  country  or  inter-\\nboundaries which has been happening in the form of livestock theft commonly known as cattle \\nrustling.  \\n\\nThis longstanding threat has caused many losses of lives, destruction of property, loss \\nof livelihoods, displacement of people and closure of social amenities such as health centres \\nand schools among others and yet the Government has been quiet. \\n\\n  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  I  urge  the  Government  to  bring  to  an  end  this  barbaric  and \\nbackward activity which for a long time has been commercialised. The cartels planning this \\nare on the loose and nobody is apprehending them. \\n\\nThe Government should deploy security forces including the National Police Reserves \\nalong our borders to check the run-away insecurity in these areas. There is need to have proper \\ncommunication  networks  along  these  problematic  borders  for  efficient  reporting  of  any \\ninsecurity  incidents.  Some  of  these  areas  do  not  have  Safaricom  or  Telkom  networks  and, \\ntherefore, atrocities are done to our people and there is no means to report to any government \\nforces. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

First, is  the completion of Lodwar-Lorugum-\\nLoya-Nayopwang  Road  to  ease  movement  of  people,  goods  and  services.  Second,  is  the \\nconstruction and operationalisation of Lokiriama Border Post to promote trade between Kenya \\nand Uganda and ease movement of people, goods and services.  \\n\\nThird, is the completion of Lodwar High Court which stalled in 2015. This will help \\nscale up justice and adjudicate cases efficiently. Since this court stalled, cases are now referred \\nto Kitale which is expensive for the Government and the people who have to travel to Kitale to \\nget justice.  \\n\\nLast, but not the least, is on the up scaling of agriculture productivity. Indeed, Kenya is \\nan agricultural country and the sector contributes 20 per cent to the GDP, and employs about \\n40 per cent of the total population. The sector also provides employment to 70 per cent of the \\nrural  population.  Scaling  up  this  productivity,  therefore,  requires  sufficient  budget  that  will \\ndeliberately put our farmers into farming activities to produce more. \\n\\nAn Hon. Member: (Off-record) Point of order! \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member, I will not allow your point order. You should \\npress  the  intervention  button  which  you  have  repeatedly  not  done.  Instead,  you  have  been \\nshouting from your seat.  I call upon the Member for Tana River County to contribute. \\n\\nHon. (Ms.) Amina Abdullahi (Tana River County, KANU):  Thank you very much, \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.  \\n\\nTo begin, let me congratulate you on your election as the Deputy Speaker to the 13th \\nParliament.  We believe that you will preside over the business of this House without fear nor \\nfavor.  \\n I wish to also convey my heartfelt gratitude to the people of Tana River County for having \\ngiven me the mandate to be their Women Representative. For those of us who have been elected \\nfrom the far-flung counties, we fully understand the enormity of the responsibilities placed on \\nour shoulders by our people who constantly brave the extreme drought, insecurity and untold \\npoverty. Therefore, our debut in the 13th Parliament is not, in itself, the change that we seek for \\nour people. It is only an opportunity to make that change. \\n\\n In this regard, I wish to emphasise the sentiments made by my colleagues, especially \\nthose  who  hail  from  arid  and  semi-arid  areas,  in  particular  Tana  River  County,  which  is \\ngrappling with severe drought. It is disheartening that in this age and era, our women have to \\nhit the road under the scorching heat and cover tens of kilometres in search of water.  \\n\\nIn  his  Address  to  the  Joint  Sitting  of  Parliament,  the  President  announced  that  the \\nGovernment had embarked on distribution of relief food to drought-stricken areas. While we \\nwelcome  this  move,  I  urge  the  relevant  Government  institutions,  including  the  County \\nGovernment of Tana River, to ensure that relief food reaches everyone facing drought across \\nthe  County,  especially  areas  of  Wayu,  Hirimani,  Assa,  Kone  and  Bangale,  which  are  really \\nfacing severe drought.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  the  President  also  spoke  robustly  about  incentives  through \\nfertiliser-subsidy  programmes \\nfertiliser-subsidy  programmes.in  agricultural \\nproduction  These  subsidy  programmes  will  drive  up  production  for  those  engaging  in  crop \\nfarming such as maize.  \\n\\nthrough \\n\\nI challenge the Government to ensure that livestock farmers are also given the premium \\nthey deserve. Pastoralists significantly contribute to the GDP of this country but end up being \\noverlooked or even accorded cosmetic policy intervention. As a daughter of a pastoralist who \\nrepresents  the  people  of  Tana  River  in  this  House,  I  bear  sacred  responsibility  to  devise \\nmechanisms and collaborate with the Government to escalate extensive services to livestock \\nfarmers, increase purchase of livestock products such as beef, and invest in value addition of \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  value  chain  will  provide \\nemployment to our people and increase their thresholds.  \\n\\nLastly,  despite  being  elected  on  a  KANU  ticket,  it  is  worth  noting  that  Tana  River \\nCounty contributed to the President’s victory and is among the 39 counties that provided 25 \\nper  cent,  actually  44  per  cent  of  the  votes  –  the  legal  threshold  which  won  the  presidency. \\nHowever,  during  his  announcement  of  Cabinet  Secretaries,  none  came  from  Tana  River \\nCounty. I also urge the President to kindly consider the people of Tana River by appointing \\nthem as Principal Secretaries, Administrative Secretaries and heads of parastatals.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.    \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us have the Member for Mandera.   \\nHon. (Ms.) Umul Kheri Kassim (Mandera County, UDM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, for the opportunity. I take this opportunity to congratulate you for your election as the \\nDeputy Speaker of this august House. I thank the people of the great County of Mandera who \\noverwhelmingly elected me. I cannot take that for granted. I thank the few that did not vote for \\nme as well. I assure them that I will represent them well and ensure that services are delivered \\nto them. \\n\\n I  also  thank  the  leadership  of  Kenya  Kwanza  who  saw  it  fit  to  nominate  me  to  the \\nHouse Business Committee. As you know, HBC is a crucial committee that handles business \\nthat  comes  to  this  House.  I  want  to  tell  Members  that  I  will  ensure  that  business  will  be \\nprioritised and on time, God willing. \\n\\nTurning to the President’s speech, it was generally good, precise and to the point. The \\npoint that caught my eye is when the President spoke about the youth. As you know, the youth \\nare an integral part of this society. He said that he is going to tap their potential and nurture \\nthem in whatever they are good at. The Ksh50 billion Hustler Fund is meant for hustlers. When \\nwe talk about hustlers, we mean women, youth, persons with disabilities (PWDs), the widowed \\nand orphans. As the county woman Member of Parliament for Mandera, and on behalf of all \\ncounty  women  Members,  the  amount  allocated  to  us  is  very  little  and  cannot  make  much \\nimpact. I wish to urge the President to allocate us some amount from the Hustler Fund so that \\nwe serve our people well. He expressed his good will on the NG-CDF. We wish that he also \\nconsiders our Fund. \\n\\nThe other point that has been echoed by many of my colleagues is the biting drought. I \\nhope and pray that it does not escalate into famine. Unfortunately, Members of Parliament have \\nnot been included on the task force formed by the Deputy President to manage response to the \\ndrought. The notice says that we will be appearing before the task force on a need basis. We \\nare the people’s representatives. We have been elected by the people to represent them. This is \\nwhen they need us most. I wish and hope that the leadership of the country will think about \\nthat. \\n\\nThe  other  point  is  the  insecurity  ravaging  pastoral  communities.  For  the  last  three \\nweeks,  we  have  been  seeing  in  news  what  is  happening  in  Baringo,  Marsabit  and  Turkana. \\nMilitia and bandits are wreaking havoc and killing young, promising, gallant soldiers. In North \\nEastern, there are inter-county sporadic clan clashes because of border issues and conflicts over \\nwater and pasture. Inter-county, intra-county, inter-clan and intra-clan conflicts are issues close \\nto our hearts, but the President did not speak about insecurity. But I know the President has the \\ngoodwill. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Mogotio. \\nHon. Kiborek Reuben (Mogotio, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I take this \\nmoment to thank the great people of Mogotio and our Almighty God for enabling me to be \\nhere. The great people of Mogotio from Kisanana, Mogotio and Emining wards have special \\nplace in my heart for entrusting me with the leadership mantle. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

To those who \\nare saying the speech was short, one of the greatest speeches ever delivered to mankind was \\ndone in 1960 by JF Kennedy. The speech lasted 13 minutes. However, Hon. Deputy Speaker, \\nup to date, we still remember the contents like: Ask not what your country can do for you but \\nask what you can do for your country. \\n\\nThe President’s speech talked about agriculture which is the main pillar and can change \\nthe economy of this country, especially for some of us who come from the rural parts of the \\ncountry. He talked about it from production to manufacturing which will not only create food \\nstability but will also create employment for our young people who are languishing in abject \\npoverty, because of lack of employment. \\n\\nThe President also talked about housing which is a source of employment for the young \\npeople in this nation. It will also solve the problems which are faced by the Kenyans who live \\nin urban areas who lack housing and live in shanties. He also talked about the Hustler Fund. I \\nam a true image of a hustler and what he can achieve. The Fund can give potential to young \\npeople who are languishing back at home because they do not have capital to start businesses. \\nIf it is well implemented, it can change the lives of millions of young people who are not paying \\ntaxes because they do not have anything. This will create a tax base for this country. \\n\\nThe President was very honest in his speech by saying that the country does not have \\n\\nmoney. The country’s coffers were emptied by the previous regime. We need to do something \\nto  save,  so  that  we  can  invest.  He  addressed  our  problems  and  offered  the  solutions  going \\nforward. \\n\\nI want to donate my time to my brother, Hon. Gideon, who has been waiting for a long \\ntime to say something. People back at home are waiting to listen to the speech of their new \\nMember of Parliament in hotels and kiosks. \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. God bless you. \\n\\ntime… \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Keiyo South because the Member has donated his \\n\\nHon. Gideon Kimaiyo (Keiyo South, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker and \\nmy  brother,  Hon.  Kiborek.  Before  I  give  my  speech,  I  want  to  inform  you  that  I  am  a  bit \\ndisappointed. I came to this House at 1:15 p.m. \\n \\n\\n(An Hon. Member spoke off record) \\n\\nAllow  me  to  talk.  I  speak  for  many  new  Members  of  Parliament  in  this  House  who \\ncame here very early not only today but also for four days last week. We have been waiting to \\nbe given a chance to speak. It is unfair in all measure. We do not ask for any favour. Be fair to \\nthe new Members. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nI am afraid if this is the going to be the order of business in this House, I will be in trouble with \\nthe Standing Orders because I will ask for a fair share of our time in this House. Congratulations \\nHon. Deputy Speaker on your election. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Give him the microphone. He can have two minutes. \\nHon. Gideon Kimaiyo (Keiyo South, UDA): Okay. I know that was Hon. Kiborek’s \\ntime. Thank you for giving me my time. I congratulate you and the Speaker on your election \\nas the Deputy Speaker and the Speaker. I take this opportunity to thank the people of Keiyo \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I thank all the wards and the people who \\ncampaigned for me.  \\n\\nI  thank  the  people  of  Kaptarakwa,  Chepkorio,  Soy  North,  Soy  South,  Metkei  and \\nKabiemit wards. I also thank everybody who contributed in one way or another for me to be \\nelected  as  a  Member  of  Parliament.  I  also  thank  the  President  for  nominating  Waziri \\nKipchumba Murkomen to the Cabinet as the Minister for Roads and Infrastructure. He has been \\na father figure to us in Elgeyo Marakwet. I wish him well. Hon. Murkomen has led the way for \\nus in Elgeyo Marakwet where all leaders are young, Hon. Murkomen being the eldest at 41 to \\n42  years.  All  Members  of  Parliament  from  Elgeyo  Marakwet  are  young  turks.  Even  the \\nGovernor,  His  Excellency  Wesley,  is  around  35  years  old.  We  say  “thank  you”  to  Hon. \\nMurkomen for leading the way.  \\n \\nOn the President’s Speech, I thank him for his commitment and his determination to \\nlead  this  country  in  the  right  direction.  The  President  promised  a  paradigm  shift  from  the \\nnormal way of doing things—from the politics of tribalism, to the politics of inclusivity and \\nthe politics of issues; a shift from the politics of dynasties, to the politics of hustlers; a shift \\nfrom an economic model of trickle down, to an economic model of bottom up; a shift from \\nsubsidising  consumption,  to  subsidising  production;  a  shift  from  an  economy  that  relies  on \\nexternal  debt,  to  an  economy  that  relies  on  savings;  and,  finally,  a  shift  from  people  being \\nblacklisted on Credit Reference Bureau (CRB), to people accessing credit.  \\n \\nFinally, let me address the people of Keiyo South. I promise them that I will work on \\nthe opening of fluorspar, the construction of Kimwarer Dam that was stopped by the previous \\nregime, and the issue of the shamba system that allows you to plant your maize in the forests \\nat  the  same  time  conserve  the  forests.  I  will  speak  for  construction  of  your  roads  in  the \\nconstituency.  \\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. God bless Kenya. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Let us have the Member for Thika town.  \\n \\n \\nHon. Alice Ng’ang’a (Thika, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I do not know \\nwhether I will be audible enough. I was under the ‘weather’ over the weekend, but something \\nvery interesting took place. My Arsenal team won the Liverpool match. At least that kept me \\ngoing.  \\n \\nMay  I take this opportunity to congratulate  you and all the leaders in this House for \\nmaking it to the 13th Parliament. I also thank the people of Thika Town Constituency for giving \\nme an opportunity to represent them in this Parliament. I thank everybody—those who prayed \\nfor us, those who prayed for Kenya Kwanza, team Mama that went around and worked hard \\nevery day to make sure that we won. I thank them very much because they made sure we won \\nin every polling center in our constituency. I thank all the generals from Kiambu, led by our \\nLeader  of  Majority  Party,  Hon.  Kimani  Ichung’wah.  We  criss-crossed  the  entire  Kiambu \\nCounty and the country in search of votes. Truly, God answered our prayers. That is why we \\nare here today. \\n \\nAs we are aware, it was not an easy thing. We campaigned very hard. The yellow fever \\ntook over. The symptoms were detected across the entire country. Two weeks to 8th August \\n2022, the entire country’s momentum was unstoppable. It was like a Porsche with no brakes. \\nKenya Kwanza was leading in all real polls, not the fake polls from the establishment. We were \\nleading all over. We swept the entire country in voter mobilisation and the readiness to vote. \\nThat is how we found ourselves the majority at the national level, in both Houses and at the \\ncounty level.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, the battle was not easy, but we endured. We made sure that with \\nGod on our side, we never agreed to surrender or to be intimidated. We knew all the setbacks \\nwere going to be our setup steps for our blessings.  That is how we made it because our God \\ntook over and made sure that we were going to be living testimonies.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Deputy Speaker, if someone ever asks  you  whether  you have ever  witnessed a \\nmiracle, tell them to look at Kenya Kwanza because we are a living testimony of what God can \\ndo when He is on your side. \\n \\nI now want to add my contribution on the President’s Speech made on the opening day \\nof this 13th Parliament. The President is a hardworking kind of a man and given a chance, he \\nshall transform this country, restore it and elevate it to unimaginable levels.  In his speech, he \\naffirmed  that  he  was  going  to  jealously  protect  our  Constitution,  guard  our  institutions  by \\nstrengthening the existing ones and to ensure that we do not overrun them. \\n \\nHundreds of men and women in Kenya are going through hardships and the burden is \\ntoo heavy for them to bear.  As we speak, there are many homes that are going without food. \\nWe need to work extra hard and to go back to our basics where agriculture was the backbone \\nof our nation’s economy. Provided with all the necessary equipment and produce, our country \\ncan go back to farming. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Chuka/Igambang’ombe. \\n \\nHon.  Patrick  Ntwiga  (Chuka/Igambang’ombe,  UDA):  Thank  you  Hon.  Deputy \\n \\nSpeaker. First, I wish to congratulate you for your election as the Deputy Speaker of this House. \\nHaving a female deputy Speaker is a good thing and it shows what Kenya Kwanza stands for. \\n \\nSecondly, I wish to thank the people of Chuka/Igambang’ombe Constituency who gave \\nme a second chance to represent them in this House. This is a constituency that is known for \\nnot re-electing Members for a second time. I thank them because they made sure that I came \\nback to this House again. \\n \\nI come from a constituency that has very many stalled projects.  Everyone in this House \\nknows  what  happened  during  the  last  campaigns.    Those  who  did  not  support  the  then \\nGovernment had their projects sabotaged.  We have a county headquarter in Tharaka Nithi with \\nno access  road.  The road was assigned a contractor, but because we the people of Tharaka \\nNithi decided to unanimously support the then Deputy President, who is the President now, the \\nproject was sabotaged.  We lobbied again but we got contractors who have never reported to \\nsite up to now. So, we have a non-existent county headquarter. The county headquarters lies in \\nmy constituency. I think it is the only county headquarter in this country that has no court, no \\nHuduma Centre and no facilities at all just because we were punished for supporting the Kenya \\nKwanza Alliance. I wish to thank the President, William Ruto because he recognised all that \\npain  and he has finally rewarded Tharaka Nithi  with  a Cabinet Secretary.  I wish to  tell  this \\nHouse that Tharaka Nithi is the only county, I think, that has never had a Cabinet Secretary \\nsince independence. Kithure Kindiki is the first Cabinet Secretary from Tharaka Nithi.  \\n \\nBeing  a  health  professional,  I  was  very  happy  when  the  President  talked  about \\nUniversal Health Care (UHC). Hon. Deputy Speaker, we can discuss airports and loans but the \\ngreatest burden to the people of this country is in those sectors. I happened to be in the last \\nParliament and we travelled to Cuba to benchmark their system. I want to tell this House that \\nwhen I landed in Cuba I wondered what  we  are doing as a country.  They did not have big \\nhospitals or equipment but it was how they have organised healthcare.  \\n\\nI  felt  so  good  when  the  President  talked  about  primary  healthcare,  preventive  and \\npromotive health care. In this country, we treat our people when they are too sick. We normally \\ntalk theoretically  about  visiting a doctor for check up, but  how many Kenyans can  afford a \\ncheck-up? While on my visit to Cuba with other Members we found a well organised health \\nsystem. For example, in every village, we have a doctor, a clinical officer and a nurse who go \\nhouse to house in a location checking on the people to ensure that they do not get extremely \\nsick before they go to hospital. I really wish that will be the meaning of primary healthcare in \\nthis country.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from Tharaka Nithi where we have a bridge called Nithi. \\nThe President in his last speech promised that he would work on this bridge. It has been a killer \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 51 \\n\\nbridge in this country. It is not only the people of Tharaka Nithi who die along this bridge. It is \\nreally an issue that the people of Tharaka Nithi would wish the President worked on.  \\n  \\nAdditionally, we know that the President is so passionate about agriculture and until \\npeople can feed themselves they remain  slaves. Agriculture is  the back bone of  the Kenyan \\neconomy. Today  coffee, tea and milk  farmers in Mount Kenya have been made paupers by \\ncartels. When I talk about cartels I cannot forget about the milk sector which has the largest \\ncartels and we know their quotas.  \\n\\n The President also mentioned boda boda and I wish we can remove the high taxes we \\nhave placed on motorbikes so that our young people can, at least, afford to buy boda bodas for \\nthemselves. Most of them are currently working for rich people who can afford to buy them at \\nthat expensive price.  \\n\\nFinally, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I was in my constituency yesterday… \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Bomet County also known as Toto \\n \\n\\n(Hon. Member spoke off the record) \\n\\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Member unless you press the intervention button I will \\n\\nnot see you.  \\n\\nMember for Bomet County! \\nHon. Linet Chepkorir (Bomet County,  UDA):  Thank  you, Hon. Deputy  Speaker.  I \\ntake  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Almighty  Father  for  being  with  us  all.  I  would  like  to \\ncongratulate you on your election as the Hon. Deputy Speaker. I also congratulate Hon. Mosses \\nWetangula, for being elected as the Speaker of this House. I thank the people of Bomet County \\nfor believing in me. I thank them for voting me in and for their prayers.  \\n\\nAs  you  may  know,  I  just  graduated  and  went  to  vie  for  this  particular  seat.  For  the \\npeople  of  Bomet  who  assisted  me,  allow  me  to  mention  one  person  by  the  name  Gideon \\nCheruiyot, who when I declared my ambition he came to my home and asked me whether I \\nwas serious about my ambitions. He then decided to assist me with his boda boda which he \\nused to fuel using his own money. He took me to the campaign field in the morning and back \\nhome in the evening. Gideon wherever you are, may God bless you. You really impacted my \\ncampaign, not forgetting the people of Bomet who printed posters, prayed for me, supported \\nme  financially  and  finally  voted  me  in.  Thank  you  for  believing  in  me  despite  my  age  and \\nstatus. I want to affirm to you that we shall walk together and I will not let you down. I am here \\nin the 13th Parliament to represent your interests.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  congratulate  the  people  of  Kenya  for  voting  in  our  President,  His \\nExcellency, Hon. (Dr.) William Samoei Ruto. I know that with this new Government, we will \\nassist very many Kenyans. I thank him for introducing the Hustler Fund. I am aware that in the \\n13th  Parliament  we  have  so  many  hustlers  and  in  that  regard,  since  it  is  the  home  of  many \\npeople, everything is possible. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am happy to stand in this House as the \\nyoungest Parliamentarian in this country. I never take that for granted.  \\n\\nOn  the  President’s  speech,  the  President  talked  about  agriculture.  I  know  he  will \\nimprove  on  that  sector  and  our  people,  especially  in  my  County  of  Bomet,  will  be  able  to \\nenhance income and food production.  \\nThere is also the issue of Hustler Fund of Ksh50 billion in each financial year. I know \\n \\nvery many hustlers will be able to be in a better position. We have the hawkers and the Micro \\nSmall  and  Medium-sized  Enterprises  (MSMEs)  that  will  be  able  to  enhance  their  business \\nenterprises. With those few remarks, I thank you. May God bless us all.  \\n \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Mathira.  \\nHon. Eric Kahugu (Mathira, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I must thank \\nyou for giving me this opportunity to make my first speech in this House. Secondly, I must \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c11th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                 52 \\n\\ncongratulate you for having been elected as the Deputy Speaker for the 13th Parliament. My \\nname is Erick Wamumbi , the Member for Mathira.  \\n\\nMy  election  was  a  miracle.  I  was  not  prepared  for  this  until  the  former  Member  of \\nParliament for Mathira was elevated to become the second Deputy President of this Republic. \\nThat is how my election came by. For that reason, I must thank the people of Mathira for having \\ntrust in me, for believing in me and for electing me to represent them in this august House. I \\nwill not forget to thank my mentor, my friend, His Excellency Rigathi Gachagua who held my \\nhand, who believed in me, and who believed in a young leader.  \\n\\n I  was  agitated  when  the  nominated  Member,  Hon.  Mbadi,  said  that  the  Deputy \\nPresident has been saying that it is their time to eat. I would like to tell Hon. Mbadi that H.E \\nthe Deputy President is not a petty man. He is consistent and he means what he says. He said \\nthat the Government which is led by President William Ruto and his Deputy will work for all \\nthe people of this country — those who voted for them and those who did not vote for them.  \\nThere are the two things that I took time to listen to in the President’s Speech. One is \\nthe Hustler Fund. We have so many young people who are languishing in poverty and some of \\nthem  end  up  seeking  employment  in  foreign  countries  and  they  are  being  tortured  in  those \\ncountries. When that credit is availed we will make sure that young men and women of this \\ncountry engage in business. They will no longer seek employment in countries that are torturing \\nthem.  \\n\\nFinally, on agriculture, I am happy that the President has committed to revive irrigation-\\nfed agriculture as compared to rain-fed agriculture. It is only through business and agriculture \\nthat we are going to revive the economy of this country. We have seen the President and his \\nDeputy have already started distribution of fertiliser to enable farmers engage in farming.  \\n\\nLastly,  the  most  important  thing  they  are  going  to  do  is  to  revive  irrigation-fed \\nagriculture so that our people can engage in farming , and that  the coffee farmer, milk farmer, \\ntea farmer will get their returns at the end of the season. \\n\\nWith those few remarks, I thank you. God bless us all, and God bless Kenya.  \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Hon. Members, having completed the four days of debate of \\n\\nthe Address of His Excellency the President, I now call upon the Mover to reply.  \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, let me \\ntake this opportunity to thank all the Members. Close to a 133 Members have contributed to \\nthis debate. That is about a third of the Members who sit in this Chamber.  I beg the Members \\nwho are preparing to exit not to do so because I will donate a few minutes to a few of them. I \\ndo not intend to take a lot of time. It is evident that many of the Members in this House support \\nthe  policies  that  were  espoused  by  His  Excellency  the  President.  Indeed,  I  know,  Hon. \\nMembers will be supporting the legislative agenda that His Excellency the President and the \\nGovernment of the Republic of Kenya will be bringing forth to this House.  I am thankful to \\nall the Members.   \\n\\nThere are many pertinent issues that have been raised by Members with regards to the \\nPresident’s Speech. They include policies, stalled projects all over the country, the state of our \\neconomy, certain counties and part of our constituencies that are being ravaged by the ongoing \\ndrought and indeed even the level and state of healthcare in the  country. I have also heard a \\nnumber of Members in their contributions touch on the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) \\neducation  system  and  as  Members  are  aware,  there  is  already  a  working  party  that  His \\nExcellency the President set in place under the Ministry of Education to look into the CBC.   \\n\\nThe President’s Address also challenged this House to amend the Standing Orders to \\nenable Cabinet Secretaries to come and espouse Government policies and tell this House what \\nthey are doing in Government, what policies they are pushing through and to answer Questions \\nand respond to Statements by Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents.  I think \\nthis is a very good step and those Members who served with us in the 11th and 12th Parliament \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

That tells you the level of \\nthinking of His Excellency the President. He wants to run an open, transparent and accountable \\nGovernment. I want to challenge Members that when the time comes; as soon as we set up the \\ncommittees on House procedures, they should quickly review the Standing Orders and allow \\nCabinet  Secretaries  to  come  and  answer  our  Questions.    That  will  put  them  to  account  and \\nmake sure that the Government of Kenya is delivering its mandate to the people of Kenya as \\nwas promised during the campaign. \\n\\nWe also have an obligation as Members of Parliament. I did say in my contribution to \\nthis speech, that, the agenda that His Excellency the President espoused through the policies \\nand legislative  proposals  that we will be bring forward are not  for Kenya Kwanza coalition \\nneither for the President William Samoei Ruto, they are for the people of Kenya.  I, therefore, \\nbeg Hon. Members to support the legislative agendas as they are rolled out because they will \\ngo  towards  improving  many  of  our  people  and  improving  our  economy  which  is  quite \\ndilapidated. \\n  \\nIn  conclusion,  I  also  heard  a  few  Members  speak  on  the  issue  of  corruption.    It  is \\nfashionable to speak about corruption, but it is better not to speak about corruption, but to act \\non issues to do with corruption.  I said in my contribution that I know the President and he is a \\nman who may fail to speak but will act.  He is a man of action and indeed, you will bear me \\nwitness  that  the  first  few  things  he  has  done  through  Executive  Orders  have  gone  towards \\nensuring we resource our institutions and institutionalise the fight  against corruption so that \\nthey are able to fight corruption and we do not end up just speaking about it and doing nothing \\nin actual sense.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, with those very many remarks, I now beg to reply. As I do so, \\nlet me donate one minute to  Hon. Harrison Kombe, Hon. Mary Emaase,  Hon. Taitumu  and \\nrepresenting Independents Hon. Kitilai. It must be half a minute each.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member of Kikuyu and the Leader of the Majority Party, you \\nhave already completed the reply. So, you cannot donate the time, you should have done that \\nbefore. \\n \\nmay I then continue. \\n\\nHon. Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu, UDA): Before I replied? Hon.
