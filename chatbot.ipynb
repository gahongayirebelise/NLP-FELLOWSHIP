            "[<Document: {'content': 'entry  and  scrutiny  for  all  central  government  projects  Experience  has  shown  that  this  measure has considerably contributed to the improvement of the quality and transparency  of  public  projects  Significant  progress  has  also  been  achieved  in  other  areas  of  public  investments,  which  now  call  for  further  policy  guidance:  eg  development  of  a  PPP  framework  and  the  introduction  of  PPPs,  alternative  forms  of  investment  engaging  the  private sector, advancements in decentralization   The  objective  of  this  policy  is  to  achieve  the  country’s  strategic  development  goals  by  transforming  the  “National  Public  Investment  Policy”  into  a  “National  Investment  Policy”,  which  addresses  public  as  well  as  private  investment  It  is  intended  to  lay  the  ground  to  carefully  balance  new  public  investment  projects  and  potential  dis-investment  needs  with  options  to  strengthen  private  sector  participation  This  means  building  upon  existing  principles  and  widening  the  scope  of  the  policy  to  efficiently  cover  the  involvement  of  private sector in public investments through PPPs and Joint Ventures   This “National Investment Policy” is intended to guide the country in its investment program  by ensuring:   1  Prioritisation of investments based on strategic goals, which also guides long-term   budgeting and debt-management;   2  Improving implementation through feeding back execution data to ensure strategic   and efficient management of the project portfolio and   3  Transparency and accountability over the investment cycle to enable budget agencies   on central and local level to plan and prioritise effectively;   4  Engaging the private sector and leveraging alternative sources of financing by:   increasing confidence in a credible pipeline of projects and systematically targeting a  wider range of strategic investment forms            2   2  Foundation of the National Investment Policy   21  Definitions, terminology   Public Investment Management (PIM) comprises all processes and procedures needed for  the  efficient  delivery  of  Public  Investments,  including  planning,  formulation,  appraisal,  selection & budgeting, execution, monitoring, reporting & evaluation, using a computerized  software/database  The  delivery  of  public  investment  may  be  through  traditional  public  investment,  State  Own  Enterprises,  Joint  Venture  schemes  and  Public  Private  Partnership  (PPP) arrangements   State  Owned  Enterprises  (SOEs)  are  defined  as  corporate  entities  recognised  by  national  law  as  an  enterprise,  and  in  which  the  state  exercises  ownership  This  includes  joint  stock  companies,  limited  liability  companies  and  partnerships  limited  by  shares  In  addition,  statutory  corporations,  with  their  legal  personality  established  through  specific  legislation,  are  considered  as  SOEs,  if  their  purpose  and  activities,  or  parts  of  their  activities,  are  of  a  largely economic nature1   In the National Investment Policy, an SOE is defined as a legal entity that is fully or partially  owned by the Government of Rwanda in order to undertake economic activities   A Joint Venture, generally, is an association of firms or individuals formed to undertake a  specific business project It is similar to a partnership, but limited to a specific project (such  as producing a specific product or doing research in a specific area)2   With regard to this policy, a joint venture is defined as a business arrangement, in which the  Government of Rwanda (GoR) agrees with one or more private sector parties to pool their  resources  for  accomplishing  a  strategic  investment  The  venture  is  its  own  legal  entity,  in  which each of the participants is responsible for its share in accordance with the prevailing  shareholding  structure  and  likewise  for  profits,  losses  and  costs  associated  with  it  Joint  Ventures operate in the commercial market, where GoR is a joint investor but not the sole  customer for the service provided    Public  Private  Partnerships (PPPs)  are  defined as  \"a  long-term  contract  between  a  private  party and a government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private  party  bears  significant  risk  and  management  responsibility,  and  remuneration  is  linked  to  performance\"3   According to Law Nº 14/2016 of 02/05/2016 governing public private partnerships PPPs are  similarly  understood  as  a  broad  modality  to  procure  public  investments  with  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector,  potentially  leveraging  private  financing  and  technical  know-how to deliver the project The basic principle for PPPs is that risks are allocated to the  party best able to mitigate the respective risk, thereby arriving at an optimal risk allocation                                                           1  OECD, 2015, “Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises”  2  OECD, 2002, “Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law”  3  http:  //  pppworldbankorg  /  public-private-partnership  /  overview  /  what-are-public-private-  partnerships      3   Privatisation  of  public  enterprises  refers  to  transfer  of  ownership  and  control  of  government or state assets, firms and operations to private investors4   Privatisation, in the sense of this policy, encompasses the transfer of ownership of property  or businesses from the Government of Rwanda to a privately owned entity, hence aiming at  selling shares of (partly) state owned enterprises (SOE), including Joint Ventures    National Investment Program (NIP) is a consolidation of all public investment projects over  the medium term, which is either ongoing or planned (pipeline) Prerequisite for all projects  to be included in the NIP comprises is the approval by PIC  The pipeline section of the NIP  is  used  as  a  tool  to  coordinate  mobilization  of  external  resources  through  offering  well- prepared and economically viable projects   A Project is a set of activities over an established timeline and budget intended to achieve a  developmental  objective,  which  is  defined  through  outputs  According  to  this  policy  the  definition  also  comprises  ‘programmatic’  projects,  which  combine  smaller  projects  into  larger  investments  in  order  to  ease  planning  and  management  procedures  Projects  can  mainly be divided into capital investments and technical assistance development projects   Capital  Investment  entails  expenditure  targeting  the  acquisition  of  fixed  assets,  thereby  contributing  to  fixed  capital  formation  Potential  fixed  assets  comprise  eg  buildings  and  structures,  machinery  and  equipment  This  category  of  investment  also  includes  major  improvements  (renovations,  re-constructions  or  enlargements)  of  existing  fixed  assets  In  this  respect,  capital  investments  increase  the  performance  or  capacity  of  an  existing  fixed  asset  or  significantly  extend  it  beyond  the  previously  expected  service  life,  thereby  increasing the value of the asset   Technical  assistance  development  projects  comprise  sets  of  activities  focussed  either  on  social  transfers  or  on  capacity  development  /  knowledge  transfer  through  coordinated  programs consistent with Rwanda’s priorities   Contracting authority includes institutions engaging in a contract for goods or services such  as:  Ministries,  Agencies,  Districts,  City  of  Kigali  and  State  Owned  Enterprises  /  Public  Utilities   22  Scope of investment subjects covered    Against  the  backdrop  of  the  mentioned  objectives,  this  policy  mainly  deals  with  publicly  driven  investments  on  central  and  local  government  level  as  well  as  investments  of  commercial nature In theory, investments are defined as long-term commitment of funds in  real or in intangible assets Since the National Investment Policy also applies to development  assistance  programs  and  technical  assistance  projects,  as  included  in  the  development  budget, a broader understanding of investments is applied    In  that  sense,  the  policy  deals  on  the  one  hand  with  “public  investment”,  which  refers  to  capital investment in public goods, like physical assets / infrastructure (eg property, roads,                                                          4 OECD, 2002, “Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law”      4   infrastructure  (eg  human  capital  government  buildings,  etc),  and  soft  assets  /  development, innovation support, research and development, etc) On the other hand, the  National  Investment  Policy  raises  strategic  ways  of  organizing  capital  expenditure  on  commercial  goods  and  businesses  This  means  investing  in  enterprises  involved  in  the  buying and/or selling of goods and/or services that are expected to generate positive cash  flows and/or beneficial effects for the development of key sectors in the Rwandan economy  The following figure shows the structure of investment goods covered            Figure 1:   Structure of investment options covered      Building upon this definition the National Investment Program shall cover all investments  in capital assets as well as in all developmental projects This means on the hand to include  all projects in the National Investment Program, which are listed in the development budget  and on the other hand to encompass all other investments, including shares and guarantees,  which may be budgeted for under recurrent expenditure    This approach serves the purposes of availing structured information on public investments  in  a  proven  manner,  to  inform  and  align  all  investment  decisions  by  government  and  to  allow for provision of credible data about the increase of Rwanda’s capital stock Following  this line of thinking means knowingly accepting that some projects or programs listed in the  National Investment Program will not be capital investments in the sense, that they do not  generate  gross  fixed  capital  formation  (GFCF),  which  as  such  has  to  last  longer  than  one  year,  with  measurable  return  on  the  invested  sum  This  applies  in  particular  to  technical  assistance projects   23  Funding Public Investments   In general, there are three sources for funding and financing public investments: i) Internal  funding sources, ii) external funding support and iii) borrowing as financing source with the  requirement to be paid back at least partly   5   Internal funding sources entail domestic tax and non-tax revenues, which are used to fund  the recurrent as well as the development budget    External funding support refers to Budget and Project Support from Development Partners  According to the Rwanda Aid Policy from 2006, Budget Support is the transfer of resources  from  a  Development  Partner  to  the  Rwandan  budget  The  same  lines  of  authority  and  procedures  that  govern  the  normal  Rwandan  budget  are  applicable  There  are  three  main  types  of  Budget  Support  in  Rwanda:  “General  Budget  Support”  is  defined  as  a  method  of  financing  the  GoR’s  national  budget  through  a  transfer  of  resources  from  a  donor  to  the  government  national  treasury  account  with  no  earmarking  to  a  sector  or  program  dealing  with  budget  allocation  “Sector  Support”  is  budget  support  provided  by  a  donor  with  the  aim  of  financing  the  realisation  of  development  objectives  in  an  identified  sector  “Budget  Support to Decentralization” is sector budget support for decentralized entities, channelled  through  Local  Administrative  Entities  Development  Agency  (LODA)  The  third  option  is  “Project  Support”,  which  is  directly  targeting  defined  sets  of  activities  under  the  development budget    Borrowing  is  used  for  the  recurrent  as  well  as  for  the  development  budget  It  can  be  differentiated  into  domestic  borrowing,  external  concessional  and  non-concessional  loans  (including  financing  via  capital  markets  issuing  bonds)  and  public  guarantees  If  a  loan  is  considered as concessional, depends on the share of a potential grant element and the terms  with regard to maturity and interest rates             6   3  Guiding principles of the National Investment Policy   Rwanda has come a long way in terms of improving public investment planning, budgeting  and  execution  In  order  to  further  improve  efficiency  of  the  investment  process  and  to  ensure attainment of investment objectives, there is a need to have a comprehensive look, on  how  to  strategically  approach  different  stages  of  investment  activity  as  well  as  on  how  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  investment  management  on  central  and  local government level    The following key principles will support the achievement of the objectives of the National  Investment Policy and will help to transform its logical framework into practice:   i  Alignment with national priorities Identification and selection of all projects shall  be  guided  by  national  priorities  laid  out  in  strategic  documents,  eg  the  National  Vision (to date Vision 2020), the National medium term strategy for development (to  date  EDPRS  2),  and  the  government  development  program  (to  date  7  Year  Government Program)   ii   Leveraging private sector Rwanda aspires to be a private sector led economy in line  with  the  Vision  2020  National  investments  will  as  much  as  possible  leverage  additional private sector financing    iii  Value  for  money  All  projects,  regardless  how  they  are  implemented,  shall  deliver  optimal  value  for  money  and  contribute  to  growth  by  maximizing  the  efficiency  through better selection, preparation and management of investments   Effectiveness  and  impact  orientation  The  selection  and  design  of  future  projects  shall  be  driven  by  systematically  assessed  experiences  about  achieved  impacts  and  lessons learnt from ongoing and completed projects   Efficiency  of  investments  This  will  be  achieved  by  ensuring  investment  selection  and  design  take  into  consideration  the  importance  of  reducing  fragmentation  and  scattering  of  resources  wherever  possible  while  increasing  complementarity  of  projects   Promotion  of  local  content  Investment  designs  and  selection  shall  consider  the  objectives  of  knowledge  transfer  and  promotion  of  the  local  economy,  especially  targeting the creation of local jobs as much as possible   Transparency  and  reliability  All  procedures  and  decisions  within  the  public  investment  management  shall  be  transparent  to  all  stakeholders  ensuring  a  sound  understanding and good predictability of resource allocation   viii   Sustainability:  investment  design  and  selection  will  be  driven  by  sustainability  considerations including long term environmental and social impacts among others   ix  Coordination  and  accountability  Roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  involved  stakeholders  shall  be  clearly  designed  to  ensure  coordination  across  sectors  and  government  levels  and  to  enable  all  institutions  to  plan  and  implement  effectively   iv   v   vi   vii      7   Investment  design  shall  integrate  accountability  mechanisms  in  different  forms  of  investment to ensure that intended objectives are achieved   x  Autonomous  decision   taking  by  Districts  Following   the  principle  of  decentralisation, investment  management  on the  level  of local  governments  will be  autonomous  as  provided  by  the  Decentralization  policy  For  purposes  of  coordination  across  the  country  central  government  institutions  will  provide  advisory and quality assurance support               8   4  Framework for the management of National Investments   41   Institutional framework, key stakeholders   Efficient and effective management of public investments requires coordination with a wide  range of entities and stakeholders; thus clear roles and responsibilities are required Existing  legal framework that guides the actions of stakeholders include:    -  Law Nº 14/2016 of 02/05/2016 governing public private partnerships, as gazetted on   30/05/2016 (PPP Law)   -  Prime Minister’s Order determining the functioning of the Public Private Partnership   (PPP) Steering Committee; approved by Cabinet on 03/02/2017   -  Law

(Approval of Finance  Bill,  as  per  Article  35  of  the  Organic  Law  on  State  finances  and  property)  It  is  also  an  important organ in ensuring accountability of investments undertaken by the Executive   Parliament   Cabinet   In the course of investment planning, implementation and monitoring, Cabinet is involved  as key decision-maker at the Executive level (Pre-approval of Finance Bill and submission to  Parliament, as per Article 35 of the Organic Law on State finances and property)   District Councils   In the course of investment planning, implementation and monitoring, District Councils are  involved as key decision-makers for investments in the respective districts    Public Investment Committee   The  Public  Investment  Committee  (PIC)  is  a  body  that  approves  ongoing  and  new  investments on central government level, which meet the requirements for implementation   The PIC will be chaired by a high-level representative of MINECOFIN The Committee will  also be comprised of high-level representatives of key spending ministries             9   Local Government Projects Advisory Committee   The Local Government Projects Advisory Committee (LGPAC) is a body, which advises on  the  quality  and  relevance  of  ongoing  and  new  projects  that  meet  the  requirements  for  implementation on district level   The  LGPAC  will be  chaired  by  a  high-level  representative  of MINECOFIN  and  co-chaired  by  a  high-level  representative  of  MINALOC  The  Committee  will  be  constituted  of  high- level representatives from Provinces and key spending ministries    PPP Steering Committee   As  per  Law  Nº  14/2016  of  02/05/2016  governing  public  private  partnerships,  the  PPP  Steering Committee will take over the gateway and oversight function of PPP projects The  Steering Committee is specifically responsible for approving the shortlisted bidders and the  preferred bidder for a PPP project    Clusters   These  are

 law  N  º  14/2016  of  02/05/2016  “governing  public  private  partnerships”,  RDB’s  role  also  comprises  the  function  of  a  specialized  advisor  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  PPPs  This  role  includes  coordinating  the  negotiation  of  strategic  investments  and  Joint  Ventures  with  potential  investors as well as following up the actualization of investments attracted   42  Procedures for the management of national investments   The public investment process covers the project life cycle from identification and appraisal  via implementation up to ex-post evaluation Procedures targeted by the policy are designed  along  key  phases  of  the  public  investment  management  process,  reaching  from  initial  guidance up to evaluation feeding back into guidance for future projects:      12   Figure 2:   Key areas of the Public Investment Management Process5   421  Strategic Guidance for Investment Planning   Project identification will be guided by existing strategic documents to anchor government  decisions and to guide sector-level decision makers toward national priorities:      \\uf0b7  The National Vision (to date Vision 2020), the National medium term strategy  for  development  (to  date  EDPRS  2)  and  the  government  development  program  (to  date  7  Year  Government  Program)  will  be  the  most  important  strategies to orient the prioritization of investments    \\uf0b7  On  the  next  level  investment  planning  will  be  informed  by  macroeconomic  analysis  and  targets,  derived  from  the  government’s  macroeconomic  policy,  eg  sufficiency  of  investment  levels  as  percentage  of  GDP  with  regard  to  targeted  growth  rates,  appropriateness  of  the  cross-sectoral  distribution  of  investment  effects,  complementarity of public and private investments as well as conduciveness  for domestic and foreign investment   consideration   employment   taking   also   into   \\uf0b7  Within  sectors,  decisions  will  be  guided  by  sectoral  strategies  and  policies,   including eg industrial policy and agricultural strategy etc   \\uf0b7  Lastly, compliance with regional strategies and policies for example the EAC   Vision 2050 and the Agenda 2063 for Africa will be considered   National  Investment  Planning  is  informed  by  the  above  mentioned  guiding  documents  There  will  be  a  feedback  loop  from  investment  management  to  inform  these  higher-level  strategies as to their realism and feasibility

Appraisal   One  prerequisite  for  an  efficient  implementation  of  appropriate  investments  is  a  sound  preparation process To ensure that projects are adequately prepared to be delivered in time  and on budget, specific levels of appraisal are required, before a project will be considered  for implementation it will go through a thorough screening and appraisal process    Figure 3:   Thresholds for appraisal requirements      All  new  proposals  for  full-feasibility  or  project  implementation  will  have  to  be  submitted  with  a  project  profile  document  (PPD),  which  includes  basic  project  information,  and  an  additional  concept  note  describing  the  design  of  the  requested  project  (full-feasibility  or  investment)  to  ensure  that  the  project  is  accurately  costed  and  can  be  tendered  and  implemented in time and in budget Depending on the type of investment, its size and the  envisaged way of implementation different levels of appraisal are necessary, see Figure 3:   \\uf0b7  Pre-feasibility studies help to identify relevant alternatives before undergoing  a  full-fledged  feasibility  study  Pre-feasibilities  assess  a  project’s  readiness,  desirability,  viability  and  most  appropriate  form  of  implementation  The  intention  is  to  identify  and  exclude  unsuitable  projects  from  further  preparation  and  assessment  with  a  reasonable  input  of  resources  Pre- feasibility studies can be carried out internally without prior screening by an  Investment Committee   \\uf0b7  Feasibility  studies  will  be  used  to  assess  proposed  projects  in  detail  on  a  quantitative  basis  requiring  comprehensive  analysis  of  market  conditions,  technical, social, environmental, financial and economic issues depending on  the nature of the project in order to determine the optimal project design and      14   form of implementation Requests for feasibility studies have to be submitted  according  the  standard  planning  and  budgeting  guidelines  issued  by  MINECOFIN to be screened by the respective Investment Committee   The necessary scope of work of the studies required will be adapted to the specific nature of  projects and set out in guidelines, which will be published to support the implementation of  suggested policy measures The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN)  has the key function as quality assurer   423  Planning, budgeting and monitoring procedures on Central Government level   The description of processes at central level highlights the function of the Public Investment  Committee   Planning and Budgeting Process for Central Government Investments   The annual planning and budgeting cycle for central government projects, which covers the  steps of independent review and selection, is designed as follows:   \\uf0b7  The  planning  and  budget  cycle  on  central  government  level  officially  starts  with  the  issuance  of  the  1st  Planning  &  Budget  Call  Circular  (1st  PBCC)  by  MINECOFIN (NDPR) This document invites all Budget Agencies to propose  new  projects  for  funding  and  to  provide  information  on  ongoing  projects  with  regard  to  their  funding  needs  for  the  upcoming  (n)  and  the  two  following  fiscal  years  (n+1,  n+2)  The  issuance  of  the  circular  includes  templates  and  guidelines  on  how  to  prepare  and  provide  the  needed  information   \\uf0b7  MINECOFIN  (NDPR)  will  carry  out  a  first  screening  of  new  and  ongoing  projects  from  Central  Government  taking  into  consideration  the  state  of  preparation,  strategic  desirability  as  well  as  the  economic  and  financial  viability    \\uf0b7  Taking   into  consideration   from  planning  consultations,  MINECOFIN  (NDPR)  will  present  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  Public  Investment  Committee  (PIC),  which  will  determine  the  priorities  for  implementation of investments   resolutions   \\uf0b7  To initiate the budgeting process the 2nd Budget Call Circular is then issued   by MINECOFIN (NBD) Ceilings are informed by the findings of PIC   \\uf0b7  The  result  of  budget  negotiations  is  compiled  in  the  National  Investment   Program    \\uf0b7  Once  the  budget  is  approved  by  Parliament,  it  becomes  law,  and  each   Ministry may commit expenditure within the approved budgetary limits   Monitoring of contract and project management on Central Government level   Following  project  approval,  responsibility  for  project  implementation  will  pass  to  the  sponsoring  Budget  Agency  (BA)  The  Budget  Agency  is  responsible  for  implementing  the      15   project,  handling  contract  and  project  management,  while  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  is  in  charge of overseeing project execution MINECOFIN will monitor expenditure and physical  progress against budget approvals and implementation plans Generally, MINECOFIN will  report to Cabinet on progress against budget and planned implementation progress   Upon  closure  of  a  project,  a  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  Budget  Agency  and  approved  by  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  This  report  needs  to  provide  an  extensive  documentation  of  the  project,  including  information  on  physical  and  financial  execution,  achievement  of  outputs,  pending  activities,  challenges  and  recommendations  This  report  will  be  submitted  to  MINECOFIN  for  assessment  and  to  update  the  Public  Investment Management System   If  projects  generate  revenues  after  their  completion,  these  need  to  be  part  of  a  special  “operational  monitoring”  by  the  contracting  authority  delivering  reports  to  MINECOFIN  This  reporting  shall  ensure  that  these  projects  are  properly  monitored  and  that  associated  income flows into National Treasury’s accounts    424  Planning, budgeting and monitoring procedures on Local Government Level   LODA  and  of  the  Local  Government  Projects  Advisory  Committee  fulfil  key  functions  within the investment process at district level   Planning and Budgeting Process on local level   The planning and budget cycle for local governments follows the same pattern as the one for  central government    \\uf0b7  The planning and budget cycle officially starts with the 1st Planning & Budget   Call Circular for Local Governments issued by MINECOFIN     \\uf0b7  All project proposals will be submitted by Districts to MINECOFIN through   LODA   submitted  projects  LODA  will  present   \\uf0b7  LODA in collaboration with MINECOFIN  will carry out an initial  screening  of  all  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  Local  Government  Projects  Advisory  Committee  (LGPAC), which will advise on the priorities for investment District Councils  will review and approve investment decisions   its   \\uf0b7  After  the  District  Councils  decision,  LODA  and  MINECOFIN  consult  on  budget  ceilings  The  2nd  Budget  Call  Circular,  related  to  district  investment  plans, is then issued by MINECOFIN to begin the budgeting process on local  level   \\uf0b7   In accordance with the law No 62/2013 of 27/08/2013 establishing the Local  Administrative  Entities  Development  Agency  (LODA)  and  determining  its  mission,  organisation  and  functioning,  all  the  development  projects  implemented  by  decentralised  entities  shall  be  financed  through  LODA  to  increase efficiency and eliminate duplication  Within this process, LODA, in      16   collaboration with MINECOFIN, will hold consultations with each District in  order to finalise the budget proposals in the light of funding availability and  arrive  at  a  final  allocation  for  each  District  For  externally  funded  projects,  LODA will negotiate funds; the approved ones will be part of the projects to  be presented to LGPAC for quality assurance    \\uf0b7  LODA  submits  the  development  investments  and  corresponding  budget  to  the  Districts,  then  each  District  presents  its  development  projects  to  the  respective District Council The final budget is sent to Parliament, where it is  subject to the detailed scrutiny of the Budget Committee   \\uf0b7  Once the budget is approved by Parliament, it becomes law, and each District   may commit expenditure within the approved budgetary limits   Monitoring of contract and project management on local government level   The  Chief  Budget  Manager  of  the  respective  District  is  in  charge  of  overseeing  project  execution  LODA  will  track  expenditure  and  physical  progress  against  budget  approvals  and  implementation  plans    Generally,  LODA  will  report  to  Cabinet  via  MINECOFIN  on  progress against budget and stated outputs   Upon closure of a project, a project completion report will be prepared by  the District  and  approved  by  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  This  report  will  be  sent  to  LODA  for  assessment  and forwarded to MINECOFIN for updating the Public Investment Management System   The Chief Budget Manager shall ensure  that potential revenues from such investments are  properly  monitored  and  reported  on  and  that  associated  income  flows  into  the  Local  Government Consolidated Fund   425  Evaluation   Monitoring and evaluation are important management tools to track progress and facilitate  decision  making  Both  shall  provide  information  that  is  credible  and  useful,  enabling  the  incorporation  of  lessons  learned  into  the  planning  and  decision  making  process  While  monitoring  can  be  defined  as  a  continuing  function  that  aims  primarily  to  provide  the  management  and  main  stakeholders  of  an  ongoing  project  with  early  indications  of  progress,  or  lack  thereof,  in  the  achievement  of  results;  evaluation  is  the  systematic  and  objective  assessment  of  an  on-going  or  completed  project  with  regard  to  its  results  and  impacts at defined stages The aim is to determine the relevance and fulfilment of objectives,  investment  efficiency  and  effectiveness,  as  well  as  impact  and  sustainability  Stages  of  evaluation  that  matter  for  investment  projects,  depend  on  type,  size  and  sector,  these  are:  Ex-ante evaluation / ex-ante impact assessment, mid-term review, end-of-project evaluation,  ex-post evaluation (3-5 years after completion)   Evaluations  go  beyond  a  micro-economic  assessment  of  projects  and  therefore  require  enhanced preparatory works and an extended scope of work for institutions involved:   \\uf0b7  Properly worked out baseline;      17   \\uf0b7  Accurate description of chain from inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes to   impact;   \\uf0b7   Intervention  logic  of  projects  needs  to  be  properly  worked  out,  and  (at  minimum) put in a log frame (depending on project type);   \\uf0b7  Design of monitoring and evaluation functions with roles for Line Ministries,  independent   times)   MINECOFIN,  LODA,  Auditor  General,  and  evaluation    (at   Since  the  most  targeted  socio-economic  impacts  only  become  measurable  some  years  after  project completion, ex-post evaluation is a privileged type of evaluation among national and  multi-national  development  Banks  and  other  Investment  agencies  Whereas  ex-post  evaluation  of  single  investment  projects  comes  with  the  inconvenience  that  its  results  can  only inform future projects, it is a very important tool for investment programs, which are  rolled out over many years and locations   Complying  with  evaluation  requirements  is  international  best  practice  Therefore  an  assessment will be carried out to deliver a sound concept, how to adequately fit the logic of  evaluation of investment projects into the institutional setting tailored to Rwanda’s needs    Evaluations  for  central  government  projects  will  be  carried  out  or  commissioned  by  MINECOFIN or the executing Budget Agency For local government projects, the District or  LODA  may  commission  an  evaluation  Third  parties  may  also  conduct  an  evaluation  of  a  project with authorization of MINECOFIN    The  performance  of  strategically  important  projects  will  be  subject  to  evaluation  after  closure,  to  assess  their  outputs  against  the  targets  and  Key  Performance  Indicators  set  at  feasibility stage    Aims of the ex-post evaluation are to:   \\uf0b7  assess  how  well  individual  projects  are  achieving  the  targets,  especially  on   outcome and impact level, set for them at feasibility stage and   \\uf0b7  Systematically  collect  information  on  project  costs,  outputs  and  impacts  to   inform future project appraisals and improve the design of future projects            18   43  Selecting the suitable form of implementation of public investments   One  objective  of  the  National  Investment  Policy  lies  in  engaging  the  private  sector  and  leveraging  alternative  sources  of  financing  by  systematically  targeting  a  wider  range  of  strategic investment forms       Figure 4:   Matrix of investment forms   The matrix represents the landscape of (most) available forms of investment There are three  generally preferable vectors of evolution to be seen, which are indicated by the blue arrow:    (1) Considering scarcity of public domestic capital it is desirable to move to the right and to  unlock private commercial investments;    (2)  With  regard  to  technology  and  knowledge  transfer  it  is  attractive  to  stimulate  international  participation  in  investments  (the  four  lower  right  cells:  to  the  sorts  of  Joint  Ventures, international PPPs, consortia and FDI) and    (3)  Turn  upwards  and  target  the  whole  column  to  the  right,  aiming  at  a  substantially  growing share of Rwandan national companies    At  present,  the  Rwandan  economy  is  strong  in  the  left  column  [cells  (1),  (2)  and  (3)],  the  implementation  of  public  investments  with  either  public  funds  or  financial  aid  from  development  partners  The  next  step  for  the  economy  will  be  to  further  increase  the  investment share and involvement of the private sector and to identify innovative sources of  financing    With  regard  to  the  matrix,  this  means  targeting  the  middle  column  [cells  (4)  and  (5)]:  Applying  the  concept  of  PPPs  systematically  means  engaging the  private  sector,  including  foreign companies, to finance and deliver a specified public service or public infrastructure      19   An enhanced way of collaborating with the private sector will be Joint Ventures They will  be aiming at a more private sector driven approach to commercial investments limiting the  temporal  participation  of  the  government  by  agreeing  upon  clear  exit  and  risk  mitigation  options  The  possibility  to  strategically  withdraw  from  Joint  Ventures  forms  part  of  the  concept of privatisation, which generally covers the divestiture of shares in existing (partly)  state owned enterprises   431   Involving the private sector through PPP arrangements   PPPs are relatively new in Rwanda It is the objective of Rwanda to expand the application  of PPPs across sectors where they demonstrate potential for sustainable development gains  In  this  regard,  PPPs  are  seen  as  a  suitable  step  to  attract  further  domestic  and  foreign  investors  by  efficiently  sharing  inherent  project  risks  and  thereby  making  investing  in  the  provision of public goods and services more attractive for private partners   432  Founding State Owned Enterprises   Founding  new  state  owned  entities  shall  be  an  option  to  drive  economic  development  in  cases,  where  public  investment  is  needed  due  to  market  failure  causing  the  absence  of  private sector interest or where promising business cases in strategic sectors, like transport,  agriculture, manufacturing, etc, are too risky to be developed by the private sector Another  rationale  applies,  when  there  is  a  need  to  enhance  public  services  to  improve  the  population’s well-being (eg public utilities for water, electricity, sanitation…)   The  aim  founding  new  SOEs  should  be  to  create  an  environment  that  attracts  and  gives  confidence  to  the  private  sector  to  invest  (catalytic  investments)  Upon  the  market’s  readiness to invest, the State shall consider privatizing the entity by selling off its shares    433  Catalysing the development of private businesses through Joint Ventures   Joint  Ventures  are  meant  to  be  used  as  an  instrument  to  incentivize  and  drive  private  investments in strategic commercial markets with foreign and domestic partners, which are  seen as key to develop the Rwandan economy The rationale to promote Joint Ventures is to  tap  into  strategic  opportunities  and  to  encourage  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  into  strategic sectors   The  formulation  of  clear  exit  or  risk  mitigation  strategies  for  the  public  share  within  Joint  Ventures  will  be  part  of  all  investments  in  order  to  minimize  public  interventions  in  commercial  markets  Exceptions  can  be  useful,  where  there  is  a  special  public  strategic  interest and a further know-how as well as technology development is deemed necessary            20   44   Including PPPs, Joint Ventures and SOEs in public investment procedures   Based on the investment procedures outlined in chapter 42 specific arrangements for PPPs,  Joint Ventures and founding of SOEs are designed to include them in standard planning and  monitoring  procedures  The  aim  is,  firstly,  to  establish  PIC  and  LGPAC  as  mandatory  checkpoints  for  all  projects  in  order  to  increase  transparency  of  future  investments  and  alignment with national priorities Secondly, planning processes will be defined in a manner  that options to increase the participation of the private sector are systematically explored    Investments  planned  to  be  carried  out  as  PPPs,  Joint  Ventures  or  SOEs  require  a  pre- feasibility study as first step of preparation During their subsequent investment cycle, they  will pass four gateway procedures:   \\uf0b7  Step 1: Approval of full feasibility   \\uf0b7  Step 2: Approval of implementation   \\uf0b7  Step 3: Implementation and monitoring   \\uf0b7  Step 4: Ex-post evaluation (operation)    441  Need for approval by PIC or LGPAC during project preparation   At project preparation stage PPPs, JVs and SOEs need to be assessed twice by PIC or LGPAC  in order to obtain green light to proceed: In the first step, the approved request to conduct a  full  feasibility  study  is  compulsory  Going  ahead  before  starting  tender  procedures,  the  approved request for implementation of the project is required   The  corresponding  requests  need  to  be  prepared  in  line  with  the  general  planning  and  budgeting  procedures  The  sponsoring  Line  Ministry  or  District  will  compose  a  Project  Profile Document (PPD) complemented by the respective study, which will be submitted to  PIC for approval or LGPAC for non-objection via MINECOFIN or LODA   Adhering to the PPP Law, all findings and resolutions issued by the PIC regarding PPPs on  central level will be forwarded to the PPP Steering Committee for final decision The option  of calling a ministerial committee will also be available for other investments deemed to be  of strategical importance At local level, the LGPAC will advise on the quality of proposed  PPPs  and  make  recommendations  as  to  whether  they  require  the  attention  of  the  PPP  Steering Committee depending on their size and impact   In the course of budget planning and approval processes, options for required funding will  be  assessed  and,  if  agreed  upon,  the  respective  project  will  form  part  of  the  development  budget  approved  by  Parliament  Information  on  fiscal  obligations  for  GoR  arising  from  PPPs,  Joint  Ventures  and  Investments  in  SOEs  will  form  part  of  the  Budget  Framework  Paper   Following  these  steps,  involving  PIC  on  central  and  LGPAC  on  local  level  systematically,  will  open  the  possibility  to  promptly  capture  these  investments  within  the  Public  Investment  Management  System  and  to  build  a  credible  pipeline  of  projects  ready  for  feasibility  or  investment  funding  For  a  speedy  procedure  and  progress  of  strategic      21   investments,  PIC  and  LGPAC  will  convene  repeatedly  throughout  the  year  to  scrutinize  investment priorities in a timely manner   442   Implementation of PPPs   Following  project  approval,  responsibility  for  project  implementation  will  pass  to  the  sponsoring Budget Agency   Tendering and negotiation of PPPs   According  to  the  PPP  Law,  Rwanda  Development  Board  (RDB)  will  act as  lead  negotiator  during negotiations relating to a PPP agreement For a gateway and oversight function on  central level throughout the various stages of the procurement procedures the PPP Steering  Committee will be authorized to approve tender documents, selection of bidders (shortlisted  bidders) and processing of procurement up to selection of the preferred bidder (refer to the  Law Governing PPPs)   The District, LGPAC, or LODA may request RDB to assist with the negotiation of PPPs on  local level    To  ensure  prudent  debt  management,  information  about  the  details  of  the  financial  agreements  will  be  shared  with  and  assessed  by  MINECOFIN  The  affirmation  is  a  strict  precondition for signing the contract A formal request for a change of budget has to be filed  by the sponsoring Budget Agency when needed   Monitoring of PPPs   For PPPs, the sponsoring Budget Agency – line ministries and districts – will be responsible  for  monitoring  service  delivery  against  the  terms  set  out  in  the  Project  Agreement  Generally, according to the PPP Law monthly reports will be addressed to the PPP Steering  Committee    On a quarterly basis, the Budget Agency will be required to provide information on physical  progress and expenditure to MINECOFIN or LODA using standard report cards For PPPs  on  district  level,  LODA  will  check  and  consolidate  the  information  and  send  it  to  MINECOFIN    According to the standard monitoring procedures, MINECOFIN will screen and consolidate  information  on  PPPs  on  central  level  and  prepare  a  quarterly  report,  encompassing  PPP  projects on both levels This brief will be integrated into the overall project reporting to be  submitted to Cabinet for information and taking of necessary decisions    During their operational phase, PPPs shall be subject to a quarterly monitoring procedure by  the  contracting  authority  in  order  to  inform  MINECOFIN  on  compliance  with  contractual  obligations; this includes potential generation of revenues    At  District  Level,  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  shall  ensure  that  those PPP arrangements  are  monitored on a quarterly basis and reported to MINECOFIN (FDU) through LODA and that      22   associated  revenues  flow  into  the  Local  Government  Consolidated  Fund,  if  not  agreed  otherwise   443   Implementation of Joint Ventures   If the feasibility study indicates that a commercial project should be carried out partnering  with  a  private  investor  targeting  know-how  and  technology  transfer  and  if  the  requested  budgetary  means  are  approved,  then  the  project  will  be  marketed  and  promoted  by  the  respective Budget Agency or District    Since a Joint Venture is commercial in nature targeting mainly private and potentially public  customers, the initiation of Joint Ventures will follow a path deviating from common public  procurement  procedures  Usually,  mobilising  private  and  in  particular  foreign  investment  into  publicly  driven  investments  will  need  a  procedure  focused  on  communication  and  negotiation  with  potential  partners  In  pro-active  (industrial)  investment  planning  Public  Private  Dialogues  will  be  applied  in  order  to  obtain  concrete  matches  of  investment  intentions and required public support measures   The negotiation of Joint Ventures on Central Level will be supported by RDB RDB will take  over this task on Local Level, if requested by the specific District, LGPAC, MINECOFIN or  LODA  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  governance  structures  to  ensure  an  adequate  representation of the public party in the Board of Directors (or similar body)     To ensure sound financial management, JV agreements will be shared with and assessed by  MINECOFIN  The  affirmation  is  a  strict  precondition  for  signing  the  contract  A  formal  request  for  a  change  of  budget  has  to  be  filed  by  the  sponsoring  Budget  Agency  when  needed   Joint  Ventures  under  operation  (including  start-up  phase)  will  form  part  of  the  government’s portfolio of public shareholdings and will be monitored accordingly   444  State Owned Enterprises   If an investment is identified to be best implemented as a State Owned Enterprise (SOE), all  essential aspects of implementation will  need to be set out with the request for funding of  the initial capital This entails a detailed business model outlining organisational structures  as well as core and supportive procedures, which will guide the implementation through the  Budget Agency or District in charge    The  process  of  setting  up  and  running  an  SOE  will  be  subject  to  monitoring  of  public  shareholdings   45  Managing the portfolio of public shareholdings   451  Monitoring Shareholdings   The  Government  Portfolio  Management  Unit  within  MINECOFIN  and  LODA  will  be  responsible for monitoring the portfolio of existing and upcoming shareholdings on central  and local government level comprising Joint Ventures and SOEs Quarterly reports will be      23   drafted to inform public decision makers about the performance of public corporations On  annual  basis,  a  review  of  all  shareholdings  will  be  prepared  in  order  to  assess  the  composition of the existing portfolio against strategic targets    Amongst  others,  required  information  will  be  sourced  from  regular  company  reports  and  minutes  of  regular  board  and  annual  shareholders’  meetings  Reports  on  engagements  on  central  level  will  be  elevated  within  MINECOFIN  If  needed,  necessary  decisions  on  managing the entities will be taken by MINECOFIN    Quarterly  reports  about  shareholdings  on  district  level  and  respective  annual  reviews  will  be  compiled by  LODA  and  submitted to  MINECOFIN  via  the  Fiscal  Decentralization Unit  (FDU)  Necessary  decisions  regarding  the  management  of  public  companies  will  be  pre- agreed with the respective District Council and will then be approved by MINECOFIN   Decisions on changes in the structure of shares directly owned by GoR, either by selling or  buying,  will  need  to  be  additionally  screened  by  PIC  or  LGPAC  All  decisions  concerning  usual  business  operations  will  be  taken  by  the  company  management  team  following  company specific governance structures    The Autonomous Government Investment Body as one of GoR’s companies will take over a  special  role  in  the  management  of  GoR’s  shareholdings  by  pooling  and  managing  commercial  and  quasi-commercial  investments  of  government  It  will  be  governed  by  the  provisions  of  the  law  relating  to  companies;  it  will  have  full  commercial  discretion  and  flexibility to undertake investments, divestments and business decisions under the guidance  of  the  board  of  directors    MINECOFIN  will  have  the  responsibility  to  monitor  the  performance of the autonomous investment vehicle as one of GoR’s shareholdings   452  Portfolio Management (Privatisation Decisions)   The  institutions  in  charge  of  monitoring  public  shareholdings  will  support  the  strategic  management  of  the  public  shareholding  portfolio  by  analysing  and  recommending  adaptations to the compilation of the existing portfolio This assessment will be guided by  two overarching principles:  Firstly, considering limited public resources and the objectives  of  industrialization,  the  invested  shares  per  industrial  line  shall  reflect  the  strategic  importance of the particular sector Secondly, maximizing the private sector involvement in  order to become a private sector led economy   Bearing  in  mind  the  latter  principle  as  one  of  the  key  issues  of  the  national  investment  strategy,  the  Government  of  Rwanda  will  regularly  review  its  investments  in  public  corporations,  with  a  view  to  devising  a  program  to  expand  the  role  of  the  private  sector  This will be done in accordance with the privatisation law, the privatisation policy and the  Law Determining the Procedure for Disposal of State Private Assets    Requests  for  the  buying  or  selling  (privatisation)  of  shares,  including  infrastructure  managed  as  government  property  representing  a  business  opportunity,  can  be  filed  by  respective  Line  Ministries,  Districts  or  decision  taking  bodies  on  ministerial  level  These  requests need to comprise concept notes clearly outlining the rationale, social and economic      24   effects and implications for the state budget They will be screened by PIC for approval or  LGPAC  for  no-objection  and  will  then  be  elevated  for  decision  taking  to  Cabinet  or  the  Economic  Cluster  Decisions  concerning  entities  on  District  Level  will  be  pre-approved  by  the  specific  District  Council  Buying  and  selling  of  shares  under  the  Autonomous  Government Investment Body shall be subject to approval of the Board of Directors, which  then informs the shareholder (GoR) in line with usual reporting rules   The sale of central or local government interests in these corporations may vary depending  upon the most appropriate mechanism for particular enterprises, but as an objective, at least  some of their shares will be listed on the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE) via an initial public  offer (IPO) to broaden and deepen the capital market   46  Tracking Private Investments   The procedures and tools set out in the preceding section will apply to any project where the  Government  of  Rwanda  has  a  direct  financial  interest  –  ie,  conventional  public  sector  projects, PPPs and JVs    In addition, as part of the national investment policy, the Government of Rwanda will track  investment  in  private  sector  projects,  in  order  to  estimate  the  total  level  of  private  investment and monitor the growth of private investments against the targets set out in the  Vision 2020 and EDPRS   Responsibility for tracking private investments will fall to the Rwanda Development Board,  which shall share the information with MINECOFIN  The tasks to be undertaken by RDB to  track private investments are set out below   1  RDB  will  register  and  monitor  all  new  private  investments  RDB  already  performs  this  function  by  issuing  Investment  Certificates  to  new  investors,  and allocating an Aftercare Officer to provide support to each project once an  Investment Certificate has been issued   2  RDB  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  MINECOFIN  on  forecast  levels  of   private investment   3  RDB  will  submit  an  annual  report  on  the  actual  estimated  level  of  private  investment in the previous year, drawing on surveys of investment actually  undertaken   4  All  projects  with  an  investment  value  exceeding  USD  2,000,000  will  be   identified within the RDB quarterly report to support economic planning            25   47  Managing key investment data   471  Establishing a Public Investment Management System (PIMS)   The  Integrated  Financial  Management  Information  &  System  (IFMIS)  will  be  expanded  to  also  serve  as  Public  Investment  Management  System  (PIMS),  a  customized  web-based  database  system  It  will  be  designed  to  prepare  a  proper  ground  for  the  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  public  investments  It  shall  be  upgraded  from  time  to  time  to  keep  it  abreast with current developments  The PIMS will contain four essential modules:   Pipeline  Module:  Projects  approved  by  the  investment  committees,  which  have  not  obtained funding in the current fiscal year will be considered for funding in the following  financial  year  These  investments  will  be  systematically  recorded  in  the  pipeline  module  according to their preparation status (eg “ready for feasibility funding”, “under appraisal”,  “ready for investment”) By this means a reliable and transparent pipeline of sound project  concepts will evolve, including projects targeted to be carried out as PPPs, Joint Ventures or  SOEs By passing through the screening process, it will be ensured that all listed projects /  investments  have  sound  information  showing:  a  convincing  concept,  their  feasibility  and  strategic alignment, representing key sectors targeted by the government   This pipeline shall be used as reliable source for a pro-active marketing of projects by either  RDB  or  MINECOFIN  or  Line  Ministries,  when  looking  for  investors  or  external  funding  sources    Project Module: This module facilitates the registration, screening / selection and allocation  of  funds  during  annual  budgeting  as  well  as  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  projects  Budget  Agencies  shall  use  this  module  via  a  web-based  interface  to  register  and  submit  projects for screening /selection during the annual planning and budgeting cycle To ensure  a simple and clear identification of projects during their lifetime, all projects will be given a  unique code   The data captured will be focussing on general project information and details on financing  and outputs To emphasize the importance of medium term expenditure projections both for  investment  and  financing  decisions,  the  database  will  be  structured  to  comprise  a  breakdown  of  cost,  including  maintenance  and  operation  cost,  and,  if  applicable,  revenue  estimations  To  facilitate  the  strategic  management  and  monitoring  of  the  investment  portfolio, this module will include all types of projects Investments in form of JVs and SOEs  will be captured up to the selection stage and the approval for implementation From then  on JVs and SOEs will be managed as part of the portfolio of public shareholdings   PPP Module: This module will capture details about the implementation of Public Private  Partnership (PPP) projects The purpose will be to support tracking, managing and reporting  on all PPPs   Reporting Module: This module will avail management reports and executive summaries of  information captured in PIMS to facilitate decision making It shall be flexible to create and  generate analytical reports according to specific purposes      26   The PIMS shall be linked to other government databases, to facilitate swift information flow  and enhance efficiency in the delivery of public investment projects, eg the M&E Database  for  projects  on  local  level,  the  Public  Debt  Management  System  and  National  Bank  Information  Systems  The  PIMS  shall  be  made  accessible  to  all  public  institutions,  which  perform any role in process of delivery of public investment or capital expenditure Staff of  budget  agencies  shall  be  given  user  IDs  and  passwords  with  the  relevant  restrictions  for  various uses   472  Documentation as audit trail   To  ensure  probity  and  transparency  in  the  use  of  public  funds,  in  any  case  where  public  investment  is  committed  to  projects,  whether  directly  or  via  a  PPP  or  Joint  Venture  agreement,  the  project  cycle  will  be  documented  by  a  full  audit  trail  from  inception  to  completion within the Public Investment Management System            27   Annex I:   Implementation Plan   Objective  Awareness about  National Investment  Policy raised   Activity  Produce distributable version of  National Investment Policy and  disseminate to stakeholders  Explain innovations of policy in  regular trainings for planning  officers and in sector meetings on  project execution  Include module on National  Investment

FOReWORD  The  Vision  2020  is  a  reflection  of  our  aspiration  and  determination  as  Rwandans,  to  construct  a  united,  democratic  and  inclusive  Rwandan  identity, after so many years of authoritarian and exclusivist dispensation   We aim, through this Vision, to transform our country into middle - income  nation  in  which  Rwandans  are  healthier,  educated  and  generally  more  prosperous The Rwanda we seek is one that is united and competitive  both regionally and globally  To achieve this, the Vision 2020 identifies six interwoven pillars, including  good  governance  and  an  efficient  State,  skilled  human  capital,  vibrant  private sector, world class physical infrastructure and modern agriculture  and  livestock,  all  geared  towards  prospering  in  national,  regional  and  global markets  This Vision is a result of a national consultative process both at inception,  between 1997 and 2000 and in 2012 when the Vision was revised The  discussions and debates involved Rwandans from all walks of life, including  leadership  from  all  levels  in  the  business  community,  government,  academia and civil society  More than a decade since implementation of the vision began, the results  speak  for  themselves  Out  of  the  47  indicators  in  the  original  Vision  2020;  26%  (12)  have  already  been  achieved  The  successes  come  as  a  result of a collaborative effort between Rwanda and our partners It is a  demonstration of what can be achieved when we give value to ourselves  and the work we do, when we strive to find solutions from the strengths  of  our  culture  The  efforts  and  determination  of  the  Rwandan  people  have necessitated revision of our targets upwards to match our growing  ambition and to demonstrate our unwavering resolve to make a better  livelihood for all Rwandans   Vision 2020 is a shared purpose for all Rwandans We need to constantly  remind ourselves how our work – in our individual capacities, communities,  business and public institutions – contributes towards realizing this Vision  Like all achieving societies whose success is generally inspired by a shared  purpose, our Vision 2020 constitutes a bond that holds Rwandans as a  people determined to build a better future  i  I am certain that Vision 2020 will continue to inspire us to achieve our  goals, and that our Vision is clearly and powerfully stated – thus setting  in  motion  the  vital  energy  and  the  sense  of  urgency  needed  for  its  realization  I  thank  all  Rwandans  and  Friends  of  Rwanda  who  will

What  kind  of  society  do  they  want  to  become?  How  do  they  construct  a  united  and  inclusive  Rwandan identity? What are the transformations needed to emerge from  an  unsatisfactory  social  and  economic  situation?  These  are  the  main  questions Rwanda Vision 2020 addresses  Vision 2020 was a result of a national consultative process that took place  in Village Urugwiro between 1998-1999 There was a broad consensus on  the necessity for Rwandans to clearly define the future of the country  This process provided the basis upon which this Vision was developed   Since  then  Rwanda  has  made  much  progress  towards  attaining  these  objectives and even surpassed some of the targets In 2011, with less than  10 years towards the realization of the Vision, it was necessary to assess  the relevance of the indicators and targets and ensure that they continue  to reflect the ambition and the progress of the country towards attaining  its  long  term  development  goals  This  culminated  in  a  revision  of  the  original  Vision  2020  targets  through  a  consultative  process  where  the  revised targets were adopted at the 9th Leadership retreat in February  2012 The original Vision 2020 contained 47 indicators and targets, which  have been revised to a total of 48  The guiding rationale for the revision was based on the following:  1  Aligning  targets  to  level  of  low  middle  income  countries:  an  analytical comparison has been made of Rwanda and middle income  countries and adjustments made where necessary The most notable  change  is  the  adjustment  of  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  per  capita to meet the changing thresholds of middle income countries  The existing Vision 2020 target for GDP per capita has been revised  from USD 900 to USD 1240 The current threshold for lower middle  income countries is USD 1,006 to USD 3,975, upper middle income;  USD 3,976 to USD 12,275; and high income; $12,276 or more Meeting  this target will ensure Rwanda moves into the lower middle income  category by 2020   2  Harmonizing  with  the  more  ambitious  seven  year  government  program (7YGP) targets: Some 7YGP targets were found to be more  ambitious  than  those  contained  in  the  Vision  2020  These  include   1  among others; the target for percentage of population below poverty  line which is 20% in 7YGP while it was 30% in Vision 2020; the target  for access to electricity in 7YGP which is at 70% while it was 35% in  the Vision 2020   3   Inclusion of indicators and targets for climate change, governance,  ICT  and  regional  integration:  The  Vision  2020  already  considered  these as important areas in the six pillars; this is now reinforced with  high  level  indicators  such  as;  biodiversity,  citizen  satisfaction  with  service delivery and rule of law, and the degree of openness reflected  by the proportion of trade to GDP    4  Some  targets  already  achieved  requiring  more  ambition:  out  of  the  original  47  indicators  in  the  Vision  2020,  12  (26%)  are  already  achieved and 16 (34%) are well on-track to be achieved among which  average GDP growth rate, agricultural production (kcal/day/person),  infant  mortality  rate,  secondary  school  transitional  rate,  malaria- related mortality, admission rate to tertiary education among others  More ambitious targets have been set for the set of indicators already  achieved  2  2 CURReNT SITUATION AND THe CHALLeNGeS  21 Historical perspective  Although  Rwanda  has  made  significant  progress  from  the  devastation  that marked the nation in the immediate aftermath of the 1994 genocide  against  the  Tutsis,  it  still  remains  with  significant  challenges  amongst  which  are  449  %  of  the  population  still  living  under  the  poverty  line  In  order  to  fully  understand  the  present  situation,  it  is  important  to  appreciate Rwanda in a historical perspective  Since the 11th century, Rwanda existed as a nation founded on a common  history  of  its  people,  shared  values,  a  single  language  and  culture,  extending well beyond the current borders of the country The unity of  the  Rwandan  nation  was  also  based  on  the  clan  groups  and  common  rites with no discrimination based on ethnicity  The  colonial  power,  based  on  an  ideology  of  racial  superiority  and  in  collaboration  with  some  religious  organizations,  exploited  the  subtle  social  differences  and  institutionalized  discrimination  These  actions  distorted the harmonious social structure, creating a false ethnic division  with disastrous consequences  The history of Rwanda can be summarized by the following key events:  •\\t The 1884 Berlin Conference  placed  the Kingdom  of Rwanda  under   German  rule as part of Deutsch Ostafrica (German East Africa);  •\\t During the subsequent partition of Africa in 1910, a big part of Rwanda  was annexed to neighboring countries This caused the loss of 1/3 of  the Rwandan internal market and a large part of its natural resources;  •\\t Following  the  1st    World  War  and  the  defeat  of  Germany,  Rwanda  was given to Belgium as a trustee territory under the authority of the  League of Nations;  •\\t After    the    2nd      World  War,  the  League  of  Nations    became  the  United  Nations  and  Rwanda  became  a  UN  Mandate  trust  territory,  under Belgian administration, until 1962;  •\\t During  the  colonial  period,  the  Belgian  administration  applied  contemporary Darwinian theories, thereby deeply dividing the people  of Rwanda This unfortunate development can be seen as laying the  foundations for periodic mass killings even after independence was  gained in 1962, culminating in the 1994 genocide  3  •\\t The RPF put an end to the 1994 genocide and thereafter formed the  Government  of  National  Unity  (GNU)  and  the  Transitional  National  Assembly (TNA) in coalition with other political parties to define a  new future for Rwanda through democratic institutions  This  historical  legacy  goes  some  way  to  explain  the  challenges  that  Rwanda faced back in 2000 when the initial Vision 2020 was elaborated  some of which remain while others have been overcome  22 Major challenges facing Rwanda today  The economy of Rwanda is currently characterized by internal (budget  deficit) and external (Balance of Payments) macroeconomic disequilibria,  alongside low savings and investment rates and high unemployment and  underemployment  (table  1)  In  addition,  Rwanda’s  exports,  composed  mainly of tea, coffee and minerals – whose prices are subject to fluctuations  on the international market – have not been able to cover imports needs  Table 1: Rwanda’s Macro-economic indicators from 1995 to 2011  Indicators Price Levels  (%)  CPI (eop) GDP Deflator  Without grants With grants  Real GDP growth Internal absorption (%GDP) Overall  budget  deficit (%

 5401 5927 50   59  4  This  overall  situation  can  be  best  explained  by  reviewing  a  number  of  constraints at the level of the economy;   Low agricultural productivity and narrow economic base: Agriculture  accounts for more than 716% (2010) of the labour force, yet remains on  a relatively high subsistence level with low productivity The agricultural  productivity  and  production  has  increased  significantly  since  2000  though there is room for tapping potentials in modernization and value  addition However, Rwandans cannot afford total dependency on farming;  strategies will be devised to move the economy into the secondary and  tertiary sectors It is clear that increases in the productivity and exports  of  Coffee  and  Tea  alone,  will  not  be  sufficient  to  build  the  Rwandan  economy Therefore efforts need to be made to expand and diversify the  economic base especially exports  Natural  barriers to trad e: Rwanda is landlocked, with long distances  from ocean ports; a factor that raises transportation costs for both exports  and imports The country lacks a link to regional railway networks, which  means most trade is conducted by road Poor quality of road infrastructure  linking  Rwanda  to  other  countries  creates  high  transportation  costs  leading  to  inflated  prices  of  domestically  manufactured  products,  and  raising the price of raw materials imported for manufacturing   Low level of human  resource  development: Since the elaboration of  the  Vision  2020,  Rwanda  has  taken  important  strides  in  tackling  the  prevalence of Malaria and halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS  The key population and health issues to be addressed remain malnutrition  and the emergence of non-communicable diseases Significant progress  has been made in tackling illiteracy and ensuring universal access to basic  education The major challenges faced in human resource development  are in developing technical and vocational skills that match labour market  needs and continuing to develop a strong base of science, technology  and innovation graduates to spearhead the move into global and regional  markets   Low infrastructure development: Rwanda has made strong governance  reforms  of  doing  business,  however,  the  major  challenge  remains  in  reducing the infrastructure-related cost of doing business especially the  high cost of electricity and low level of energy production With electricity  generation at almost 100MW, a significant step up in energy investment  with increased private sector participation will be required to meet the  targets for increased manufacturing and industrialization   5  3 MAJOR OBJeCTIVeS OF VISION 2020  The Vision seeks to fundamentally transform Rwanda into middle - income  country by the year 2020 This will require achieving per capita income of  US$1240 from US$595 in 2011; a poverty rate of 20% from 449% in 2011;  and an average life expectance of 66 years from 49 years in 2000  Taking into account the scarcity of resources, prioritization, sequencing  and enhanced coordination will be crucial This section shows prioritization  and  acknowledges  the  interdependencies  and  complementarities  between different policies and developments For example, industry and  service  sector  development  cannot  be  realized  without  a  competitive  stock of skills, infrastructure and financial services  31  Macroeconomic  stability and wealth creation to reduce aid    dependency  Rwanda  will  continue  on  its  path  to  put  in  place  macroeconomic  stabilization policies that are conducive for private sector development  This, together with a fiscal consolidation strategy aiming at expanding  the domestic resource base while rationalizing spending, and increasing  exports, is the only way to lessen aid dependence  The imbalances highlighted in Table 1 have been a source of macroeconomic  instability  and  dependency  on  foreign  aid  To  reduce  this  dependency  it will be crucial to develop effective strategies to expand the tax base  and attract foreign investors Also, there is need to continue aggressive  diversification and the development of non-traditional exports  Government  will  focus  on  private  sector  development,  desisting  from  providing services that the private sector can deliver more efficiently and  competitively With the policies in place, the economy will be able to take  up the challenge of transforming into a knowledge-based society  32 Structural economic transformation   Even  if  Rwanda’s  agriculture  is  transformed  into  a  high  value/high  productivity  sector,  it  will  not,  on  its  own,  become  a  sole  engine  of  growth In the last decade, the share of industry and services to GDP has  increased from 14% and 44% in 2000 to 16% and 46% in 2011 respectively   Transforming Rwanda’s economy will require increasing investments in  industries and services In addition to this reliance on unproductive and   6  subsistence agriculture would give place to highly productive agriculture  leading to agro-processing, industry development and exports The issue,  however, is not simply one of a strategy based on agriculture, industry  or services, but rather, identifying Rwanda’s comparative advantage and  concentrating  strategies  towards  it  A  rich  supply  of  labour,  a  large   multilingual  population,   and  strategically   located   as  the  gateway   between    East    and  Central  Africa  makes  it  advantageous  for  intra- regional infrastructure The industries established will need to address  basic  needs,  for  which  there  is  a  readily  available  market,  as  these  products can satisfy local demand and even move towards export  As for services, this sector  will become  the most important  engine  of  Rwanda’s economy Since Rwanda is landlocked and has limited natural  resources,  the  Government  will  continue  supporting  policies  geared  towards encouraging investment in services, to acquire and maintain a  competitive edge in the region  It  should  be  noted  that  the  elaboration  of  such  policies  will  not  be  suffi  cient  to  achieve  a  knowledge-based  economy    Continuous  investment  in  infrastructure  will  be  required  mainly  in  energy  and  transport to reduce the cost of doing business Improvements  in  quality  of education and health will be crucial for providing an effi  cient and  productive workforce  Figure 1: Transformation of economic activity 2011 - 2020  7  33 Creating a productive middle class and fostering          entrepreneurship  The  development  process  and  capital  formation  cannot  –  in  the  long  run  – be achieved by the state or by donor funds alone While both of  these must contribute, the backbone of the process should be a middle  class of Rwandan entrepreneurs  Productive entrepreneurship  must be  fostered  to perform its  traditional  role  of creating wealth, employment  and vital innovations through opportunities for profit  Stimulating   the   private   sector,   particularly   with   regard   to  the    promotion   of  exports   and competitiveness is not achievable without  broadening and deepening the  financial sector such as banking,  insurance,  capital market and  the  application  of  information  technology  Provision  of high quality educational services will be necessary for consolidating  development gains made in the last 10 years Rwanda aims to find a niche  market  in  the  region  by  becoming  a  logistics,  telecommunication  and  financial hub  It  is  envisaged  that  with  these  reforms,  Rwanda  will  transform  from  a  subsistence agricultural economy to a knowledge-based society, with a  vibrant class of entrepreneurs The following section outlines the major  pillars of this vision and its key components  8  4 THe PILLARS OF VISION 2020  This section focuses on the key aspects of Vision 2020 that have been  discussed so far and addresses them individually  This section will also  examine six “Pillars” through which the aspirations of Vision 2020 will be  realized  Table 2: Pillars of Vision 2020 and its cross-cutting areas  Pillars of Vision 2020  Cross-cutting areas of Vision 2020  1   Good governance and a capable   state  2  Human resource development and   a knowledge-based economy  1   Gender equality  3   A private sector-led economy  4   Infrastructure development  2   Protection of environment and   sustainable natural resource  management   5  Productive and market-oriented   agriculture  6  Regional and  international   economic integration  3   Science and technology, including   ICT  41 Good governance and a capable state  Rwanda will become a modern, united and prosperous nation founded  on the positive values of its culture  The nation will be open to the world,  including its own Diaspora  Rwandans will be a people, sharing the same  vision for the future and ready to contribute to social cohesion, equity  and equality of opportunity  The  country  is  committed  to  being  a  capable  state,  characterized  by  the  rule  of  law  that  supports  and  protects  all  its  citizens  without  discrimination  The  state  is  dedicated  to  the  rights,  unity  and  well- being of its people and will ensure the consolidation  of the nation and  its security  Social  and  economic  transformation  is  as  much  about  states  as   9  markets  In  effect,  the  role  of  the  state  is  indispensable  for  wealth- creation and development Capacity building has been one of the biggest  Government  priorities  to  ensure  the  development  and  deployment  of  public  sector  skilled  human  resources,  who  grasp  the  needs  of  other  sectors – in particular the private sector – and can translate them into  sound policies and strategies However more efforts are needed in that  area to increase citizens’ satisfaction with service-delivery We need an  effective,  dynamic public sector that can lay the foundations for Rwanda  to be competitive in the modern international economy  The  State  will  ensure  good  governance,  this  includes;  accountability,  transparency  and  efficiency  in  deploying  scarce  resources  But  it  also  means  a  State  respectful  of  democratic  structures  and    processes,   committed  to the  rule  of law  and  the  protection  of human  rights  in  particular  Participation  at  grassroots  level  will  continue  to  be  promoted  through  the decentralization process, whereby local communities are empowered  through their involvement in the decision making process, enabling them  to address the issues that considerably affect them  The  reconstruction  of  the  nation  of  Rwanda  and  its  social  capital,  anchored on good governance and an effective  and  capable  state,  is   considered  a  basic  condition  to  stimulate  a  harmonious development  of other pillars1  42 Human resource development and a knowledge-based economy  from   Apart  improving  the  general  welfare  of  the  population,  improvements in  education  and  health services can be used to build a  productive and efficient workforce  This will be essential for Rwanda  to become a sophisticated knowledge-based economy  education  Rwanda  has  made  tremendous  steps  towards  ensuring  “Universal  Education for All”, one of the most important Millennium Development  Goals,  through  the  nine  year  basic  education  program  now  moving  to  twelve years Rwanda will continue to focus on challenges in quality of  education, matching of skills to labour market needs and entrepreneurial  mindset shift   1  It  cannot  be  stressed  enough  however  that  the  6  pillars  and  3  cross  cutting  areas  have  to  be  developed in tandem – indeed this was the main message of section 3   10  Major emphasis will continue to be placed on vocational and technical  training in the fields of technology, engineering and management This  will  be  targeted  at  secondary  and  tertiary  levels,  as  well  as  various  sections  of  society  (with  particular  emphasis  on  youth  and  women)  To  encourage  skills  development,  micro-credit  schemes  will  continue  to be promoted specifically to extend finance to young, self-employed  technicians  Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  innovative,  small-scale  entrepreneurs  To  promote  efficiency  and  continuous  upgrading  of  skills,  large  scale  employment  creation  programs  will  be  launched  in  the national institutions aimed at on-job-training, in-service training and  distance learning  Rwanda lags behind in professional training, with shortages in the fields of  applied and natural sciences and ICT Although the country will continue  to  rely  on  imported  technology  from  advanced  countries,  well-trained  specialized nationals will be essential to the running and maintenance of  technological systems, ranging from medicine and agriculture to industry  and telecommunications   One crucial element to the achievement of Vision 2020 will be to ensure  a proper link between education policies and sector development and  labour  policies  It  is  crucial  to  understand  that  the  investment  needed  for  the  development  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  will  not  be  effective without a suitably skilled labour force  Health and population  The  Rwandan  population  was  estimated  at  about  8  million  people  in  2000 with one of the highest population densities in Africa and a high  population  growth  rate  close  to  3%  per  annum  With  a  population  estimated at 108 million in 2011, Rwanda remains with one of the highest  population densities in Africa   Rwanda   considers   its  population   as  its  fundamental   resource   and   banks   on  it  for   its  future development With the success of current  and  future  population  policies,  Rwanda  projects  to reduce the fertility  rate within the remaining 9 years from  46 (2010)  to 3 children in 2020  and  the  population  growth  from  about  3%  (in  2000)  to  22%  (  in  2020)  Although tremendous progress has been made with regard to the  state  of  health of  the  Rwandan population, with an impressive drop in HIV  prevalence (from 13% in 2000 to 3 % in 2011) and reduction in incidence of   11  endemic diseases (malaria and TB); challenges remain with malnutrition  and the increase of non-communicable diseases; campaigns to eradicate  malnutrition amongst children will be emphasized and to raise awareness  of prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases Addressing  the shortage of specialized health personnel and improving the quality  of  health  care  will  be  the  focus  of  health  policy  while  continuing  the  successes of home grown solutions like the community health workers  model   In  addition,  health  policies  will  continue  to  be  targeted  at  the  poorest  members  of  the  population  to  improve  quality,  and  both  geographical  and financial accessibility to healthcare Family planning remains crucial  for  controlling  population  growth  Envisaged  and  current  population  policies will go hand in hand with strategies to overcome problems in the  health sector   43 Private sector-led development  For Rwanda’s development, the emergence of a viable private sector that  can take over as the principle growth engine of the economy is absolutely  key  Not  only  will  such  a  development  be  conducive  for  economic  growth, but it will also ensure the emergence of a vibrant middle class  of entrepreneurs, which will help develop and embed the principles of  democracy  Although  foreign  direct  investment  will  be  encouraged,  a  local-based business class remains a crucial component of development  The  Government  of  Rwanda  will  foster  private  sector  development  as  a  catalyst;  ensuring  that  infrastructure  (specifically  IT,  transport  and  energy), human resources and legal frameworks are geared towards to  stimulating economic activity and growth of private investments  The continued development of the financial sector remains crucial with  an increasing number of people accessing financial services The financial  sector must be able to provide the necessary capital for private sector  development The government aims to promote local business through  the introduction of industrial parks and export processing zones in which  foreign operators could partner with local businesses  Particular attention will be paid to the labour market  More than 10 years  into the implementation of Vision 2020, the Rwandan economy has been  able to generate 12 million non-farm jobs  With population expected  to  reach  around  135  million  by  2020  and  at  least  half  the  population  depending on off-farm activities, it will therefore be necessary to create   12  16 million off-farm jobs This will require a substantial number of jobs  created in the private sector  44 Infrastructure development  The  development  of  infrastructure  is  a  crucial  aspect  in  lowering  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  Rwanda,  which  is  essential  to  attracting  domestic and foreign investments  Land use management  Land use management is a fundamental tool in development As Rwanda  is characterized by acute land  shortage,  a  land  use  plan  has been  developed    to    ensure    its    optimal    utilization    in    urban    and    rural  development    Currently,  Rwanda’s  scarce  land  resources  still  face  a  challenge of ineffective translation of the developed land use master plan  into sector strategic plans and district development plans In the coming  years, Rwanda will ensure that every development plan is guided by the  land use master plan The recent land tenure regularization will increase  security on ownership and improve productive land usage    Rwanda will continue to pursue a harmonious policy of organized grouped  settlements (umudugudization) Rural settlements organized into active  development centres will be further equipped with basic infrastructure  and services While this system of settlement will continue to serve as an  entry point into the development of non-agricultural income generating  activities, land consolidation will be emphasized so as to create adequate  space for modern and viable farming  Urban development  By  2020,  each  town  will  have  updated  urban  master  plans  with  coordinated implementation of the plans The country will develop basic  infrastructure in urban centres and in other development poles, enabling  the decongestion of agricultural zones The proportion of those living in  towns and cities will increase from 148% in 2010 to 35% in 2020 (and 10%  in 2000) The income differential between towns and rural areas should  remain  within  reasonable  proportions,  due  to  the  decentralization  of  economic activities throughout the country  13  Transport  Rwanda  is  landlocked  with  high  transport  costs  to  the  ocean  ports   of  Kenya  and Tanzania Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternative  lower  costs  of  transport  to  the  sea,  notably  through  a  regional  rail  extension to Isaka, Tanzania and an extension to the Ugandan Railway  system  Furthermore, a second airport capable of serving, as a regional  hub for the great lakes region will be developed For the internal market,  Rwanda  has  a  reliable  and  safe  transport  network  of  feeder  roads;  however, these will continue to be maintained, extended and improved  Communication & ICT  Rwanda has made a rapid improvement in ICT with fibre optic network  coverage all through the country, mobile telephone network coverage at  almost 100%, with 45% mobile subscriptions in 2011 By 2020, Rwanda  projects  to  have  internet  access  at  all  administrative  levels,  for  all  secondary schools and for a large number of primary schools Telephone  services will be widespread in rural areas and efficiency of public services  will have increased through the application of e-government principles  It is expected that mobile subscription will reach 60% and the number of  internet users will reach at least 50 % (from 43% in 2010)  energy  Inadequate and expensive electricity supply constitutes a limiting factor  to development Wood is the main source of energy for 863% (2010) of  the population down from 99% in 2000 which is a significant drop This  leads to massive deforestation and soil destruction  Imported petroleum  products  consume  more  than  17%  of  foreign  exchange  Rwanda  will  therefore  increase  energy  production  and  diversify  into  alternative  energy sources  To  achieve  this,  Rwanda  has  considerable  hydroelectric  potential,  in  addition  to  large  deposits  of  renewable  methane  gas  in  Lake  Kivu,  estimated at 60 billion cubic meters In rural areas direct solar energy or  photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155 million tons of  peat deposit is currently exploitable  Rwanda  projects  that  by  2020,  at   least  75%  of  the  population  will be connected to electricity (up from  2% in 2000 and 11% in 2010) and the consumption of wood will decrease  from the current 863% to 50% of national energy consumption  14  Water  In  2010,  742%  of  Rwandans  have  access  to  clean  water  The  country  is  endowed  with  reserves  that  could  provide  enough  water  for  both  consumption and agricultural purposes These include substantial rainfall  (between 900 & 1500 mm per year) and the abundance of lakes, streams  and  watercourses  Furthermore,  there  is  an  abundant  supply  of  high  altitude water in the western part of the country, which may be used in  providing water by gravity to the southern and south-eastern regions of  the country that face water shortages Rwanda will continue to invest in  protection and efficient management of water resources, as well as water  infrastructure  development  to  ensure  that  by  2020  all  Rwandans  have  access to clean water   Waste management  The transmission of various water- borne diseases can be attributed to  the consumption of dirty and contaminated water The unplanned and  disorganized construction of towns without a suitable drainage system  exacerbates  sanitary  problems  Sewerage  and  rainwater  can  destroy  public roads or stagnate, creating ideal breeding grounds for both human  and animal diseases Since most houses are situated on the summit and  on the slopes of hills, water sources are in constant danger of pollution  by domestic sewerage and other human activities carried by the stream  of  water  The  environmental    impact    and    waste    management    has  recently been  taken  into  account  by  human settlements and industrial  installations, but challenges remain  By 2020, the rural and urban areas are to have sufficient sewerage and  disposal systems Each town is to be endowed with an adequate unit for  treating solid wastes Households will have mastered and be practicing  measures of hygiene and waste disposal  45 Productive high value and market oriented agriculture  Since  independence,  Rwanda’s  economic  policies  have  targeted  agriculture as the main engine of economic growth Though agriculture  productivity has been increasing in the recent years, there is still room for  improvement It will be necessary to continue with the implementation  of aggressive transformational policies that move towards a modern and  more productive agriculture  15  Agricultural  policy  orientation  will  continue  to  focus  on  promoting  intensification so as to increase productivity, promoting value addition,  modernization and improved quality of livestock to achieve an average  annual growth rate of 85% The vision aims to replace subsistence farming  by a fully, commercialized agricultural sector by 2020  46 Regional and international integration  Rwanda  considers  regional  economic  integration  as  one  of  the  crucial  elements  of  achieving  Vision  2020  To  this  end,  Rwanda  will  continue  pursuing  an  open,  liberal  trade  regime,  minimizing  barriers  to  trade  as  well  as  implementing  policies  to  encourage  foreign  direct  investment  Furthermore,  policies  to  promote  competitive  enterprises,  exports  and  entrepreneurship  will  be  emphasized  Economic  zones  for  ICT  based  production  will  be  crucial  for  enhancing  competitiveness  of  Rwandan  firms  The  vision  of  accessing  larger  regional  markets  will  be  accompanied  through a program of investing in infrastructure to promote Rwanda as  a  logistics,  telecommunication  and  financial  hub  Furthermore,  taking   advantage  of  Rwanda’s  comparative  strategic  position  should  be   exploited    in    terms    of  warehouse  functions    in  trade  and  commerce  Export  processing  zones,  coupled  with  the  industrial  reforms  noted  above,  will  enable  the  country  to  consolidate  its  niche  in  services,  communication  and  financial  sectors  and  take  advantage  of  growing  regional co- operation in the Great Lakes/ Eastern African Region  16  5 CROSS-CUTTING ISSUeS OF VISION 2020  Alongside  the  6  pillars,  there  are  three  cross-cutting  areas  of  gender,  environment and climate change; and science and technology   51 Gender equality  Women make up 53% of the population and participate in subsistence  agriculture  more  than  men  They  usually  feed  and  provide  care  for  their children and ensure their fundamental education There has been  tremendous progress in gender equality specifically in education (as the  number of girls in primary and secondary education has surpassed boys  with girls to boys ratio at 103) and in decision making positions (as of  2012 women represent about 56% of parliamentarians)  In order to strengthen gender equality and equity, Rwanda will further  update and adapt its laws on gender It will continue to support education  for all, fight against poverty and practice a positive discrimination policy  in favour of women with a focus in TVET, tertiary level and in employment  opportunities Gender will continue to be integrated as a cross-cutting  issue in all development policies and strategies at both central and local  government levels  52 Natural resources, environment and climate change  To date, climate change is widely recognized as the major environmental  problem  facing  the  globe  that  is  becoming  inextricably  linked  to  development  Rwanda  is  increasingly  facing  global  climate  change  consequences including; flooding, resulting in disasters such as landslides  that  cost  lives  and  resources,  and  droughts  that  adversely  affect  agricultural  output  Other  threats  to  the  environment  take  the  form  of  depletion  of  bio-diversity,  degradation  of  ecosystems  such  as  swamps  and wetlands and pollution of waterways Rwanda will continue to put  in place strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change by focusing  on  developing  eco-friendly  policies  and  strategies  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy and by promoting green growth    53 Science, technology and ICT  Rwanda  will  continue  to  invest  in  developing  adequate,  highly  skilled  scientists  and  technicians  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  the  transition  to  knowledge-based  economy  A  knowledge  based-economy  will  require  innovative  products  that  can  be  competitive  in  regional  and  global   17  markets Having laid the foundations for ICT to take-off in the country  through  the  laying  of  the  fibre  optic  cable  network,  Rwandans  have  a  whole new world of opportunities to take advantage of More importantly  the government of Rwanda will encourage the use of ICT as a tool for  self  employment,  innovation  and  job  creation  Policies  to  encourage  development  of  smart  applications  that  meet  economic  needs  and  develop economic potential will be promoted amongst the youth ICT as  a tool for improving service delivery in both the private and public sector  will be emphasized    18  6 THe ROAD MAP  This  roadmap  lays  out  how  Rwanda’s  Vision  2020  will  be  realized   through    the    country’s  planning  process  It  also  establishes  a  set  of  yardsticks against which we can measure our progress towards achieving  the targets Macroeconomic projections and the underlying assumptions  clearly showing the requirements to realize the Vision are also made  61 Rwanda’s planning process and the realization of Vision 2020  To  ensure  smooth  implementation  of  Vision  2020  and  achievement  of  the aspirations described above, it will have to be reflected in the whole  planning process and, particularly, medium-term operational instruments   Therefore,  the  long-term  aspirations  of  the  Vision  will  translate  into  medium -term Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies  (EDPRS) at the national level   The  EDPRS  is  operationalized  through  sector  strategies  and  district  development plans The sector strategies and the district development  plans are implemented through the Medium-Term Expenditure   Framework    (MTEF); three- year fully integrated budgets that mainstream the Public  Investment Programs (PIP) of the agencies and translate into concrete  action  plans,  costed  through  annual  budgets  The  poverty  reduction  achieved through  the  MTEF  will  be  monitored  and  will  feed  back   into  the  elaboration  of  sector  and district plans   19  Figure 2: Converting vision 2020 into a reality           Vision 2020                                                  Annual    action    plans           Sector strategies   District development   plans   Annual  action  plans      Monitoring and   Evaluation   62 Achieving Vision 2020: Macroeconomic assumptions and             projections     The implementation of Vision 2020 strongly holds onto the necessity to  achieve the aspirations of the Rwandan people, by markedly transforming  the  economy,  turning  the  country  into  a  middle-income  country  and  parting away with extreme poverty  EDPRS          MTEFs   Annual  Budget     20  Inspired by recent robust economic performance and remarkable progress  in  reducing  poverty,  assumptions  for  the  macroeconomic  perspectives  over the period until 2020 were made, aiming at more robust growth and  more ambitious objectives  Notwithstanding the existing macroeconomic challenges stemming from  both internal and external imbalances with still sizeable aid dependence  and a large trade balance deficit, the Vision’s macroeconomic assumptions  aim for an annual average real GDP growth of 115 percent, GDP per capita  of USD 1,240, gradual but sustained improvement in the external trade  balance, higher investments and savings, and a stronger financial sector  With real GDP expected to grow on average by 115 percent per year (real  output  growth  between  2000  and  2011  was  on  average  83  percent  a  year), agriculture would need to grow by at least 85 percent and reach  about  25  percent  of  total  output  (agriculture  grew  on  average  by  56  percent a year between 2000 and 2011 and amounted to 32 percent of  total output in 2011) The industry is expected to grow by 14 percent on  average and reach about 20 percent of total output (industry grew on  average  by  95  percent  a  year  between  2000  and  2011  and  amounted  to 16 percent of total output in 2011) while services would be expected  to  continue  taking  the  lead,  growing  by  135  percent  on  average  and  expected to reach about 55 percent of total output (services grew on  average  by  102  percent  between  2000  and  2011  and  amounted  to  46  percent of total output)  Increased investments will be needed to achieve the growth objectives  from  both  the  public  sector  as  well  as  the  private  sector  Domestic  investments are expected to expand, but this will need a stronger financial  sector to mobilize the necessary savings to finance those investments  Total  investments  are  expected  to  reach  30  percent  of  GDP  by  2020  (from about 21 percent of GDP in 2011) with the private sector gradually  taking a larger proportion, and savings are expected to reach 20 percent  of GDP by 2020 (from about 14 percent of GDP in 2011)  The scaled up investments in bottleneck-releasing infrastructure projects  that are expected to bolster competitiveness and further reduce external  trade  imbalances,  will  require  equally  substantive  financing  that  the  domestic savings mobilization efforts alone will not be able to cater for  While  a gradual  reduction in the reliance on foreign aid remains  a key  objective over the medium-term, domestic revenues – that nevertheless  are expected to significantly increase – will alone not cover all the required  public  investments  A  combination  of  highly  concessional  financing   21  (in  the  form  of  grant  financing  and  concessional  borrowing)  and  non- concessional borrowing that does not adversely affect Rwanda’s external  debt sustainability will be considered, while avenues leading to a greater  participation of the private sector will also be emphasized through public  private partnership ventures  In order to realize the targets set out, we will have to streamline planning  processes so that the Vision is translated into implementable plans, with  strong linkages between set priorities and the allocation of resources It  also requires a mobilization of a substantial financial resource from the  state, the donor community and the private sector If these resources can  be efficiently allocated through the planning process, the goals set in this  Vision will become attainable  63 Institutional framework for the implementation of Rwanda’s vision  The  implementation  of  the  Vision  2020  is  within  the  ambition  of  all  players:  the  state,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  NGOs,  decentralized  authorities,  grassroots  communities,  faith-based  organizations  and  development partners The top most policy making bodies of Vision 2020  implementation  is  the  Cabinet  and  the  National  Steering  Committee  (Ministers  and  Governors)  The  Permanent  Secretaries  (PS)  forum  and  Development  Partners  Coordination  Group  (DPCG)  oversee  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the  Vision  and  ensure  that  consensus  building  around Vision 2020 implementation is realized  The  Ministry  in  charge  of  Finance  and  Economic  Planning  coordinates  the implementation and monitoring and evaluation of the Vision It also  ensures that Vision 2020 targets are considered in Sector Strategies as  well as District Development Plans  The Ministry will specifically:  •\\t

Committee  PS Forum & DPCG  Ministry of Finance and   economic Planning  23  Sector Working Group (SWG)  Joint Action Development   Forum (JADF)  CONCLUSION  Vision 2020  represents  an  ambitious  plan  to  raise  the  people  of   Rwanda    out    of    poverty    and  transform  the  country  into  a  middle-  income economy Some will say that this is too ambitious and that we  are not being realistic when we set this goal, others say that it is a dream  But, what choice does Rwanda have? To remain in the current situation  is  simply  unacceptable  for  the  Rwandan  people  Therefore,  there  is  a  need to devise and implement policies as well as mobilize resources to  bring about the necessary transformation to achieve the Vision This is  realistic based on the fact that countries with similar unfavourable initial  conditions  have  succeeded    The  development  experience  of  the  East  Asian ‘Tigers’ proves that this dream could be a reality  24  Annex  TABLe GUIDe  Annex 1: Key indicators of the Rwandan Vision 2020  No change made Revised indicators/targets New

improvement of the quality and transparency  of  public  projects  Significant  progress  has  also  been  achieved  in  other  areas  of  public  investments,  which  now  call  for  further  policy  guidance:  eg  development  of  a  PPP  framework  and  the  introduction  of  PPPs,  alternative  forms  of  investment  engaging  the  private sector, advancements in decentralization   The  objective  of  this  policy  is  to  achieve  the  country’s  strategic  development  goals  by  transforming  the  “National  Public  Investment  Policy”  into  a  “National  Investment  Policy”,  which  addresses  public  as  well  as  private  investment  It  is  intended  to  lay  the  ground  to  carefully  balance  new  public  investment  projects  and  potential  dis-investment  needs  with  options  to  strengthen  private  sector  participation  This  means  building  upon  existing  principles  and  widening  the  scope  of  the  policy  to  efficiently  cover  the  involvement  of  private sector in public investments through PPPs and Joint Ventures   This “National Investment Policy” is intended to guide the country in its investment program  by ensuring:   1  Prioritisation of investments based on strategic goals, which also guides long-term   budgeting and debt-management;   2  Improving implementation through feeding back execution data to ensure strategic   and efficient management of the project portfolio and   3  Transparency and accountability over the investment cycle to enable budget agencies   on central and local level to plan and prioritise effectively;   4  Engaging the private sector and leveraging alternative sources of financing by:   increasing confidence in a credible pipeline of projects and systematically targeting a  wider range of strategic investment forms            2   2  Foundation of the National Investment Policy   21  Definitions, terminology   Public Investment Management (PIM) comprises all processes and procedures needed for  the  efficient  delivery  of  Public  Investments,  including  planning,  formulation,  appraisal,  selection & budgeting, execution, monitoring, reporting & evaluation, using a computerized  software/database  The  delivery  of  public  investment  may  be  through  traditional  public  investment,  State  Own  Enterprises,  Joint  Venture  schemes  and  Public  Private  Partnership  (PPP) arrangements   State  Owned  Enterprises  (SOEs)  are  defined  as  corporate  entities  recognised  by  national  law  as  an  enterprise,  and  in  which  the  state  exercises  ownership  This  includes  joint  stock  companies,  limited  liability  companies  and  partnerships  limited  by  shares  In  addition,  statutory  corporations,  with  their  legal  personality  established  through  specific  legislation,  are  considered  as  SOEs,  if  their  purpose  and  activities,  or  parts  of  their  activities,  are  of  a  largely economic nature1   In the National Investment Policy, an SOE is defined as a legal entity that is fully or partially  owned by the Government of Rwanda in order to undertake economic activities   A Joint Venture, generally, is an association of firms or individuals formed to undertake a  specific business project It is similar to a partnership, but limited to a specific project (such  as producing a specific product or doing research in a specific area)2   With regard to this policy, a joint venture is defined as a business arrangement, in which the  Government of Rwanda (GoR) agrees with one or more private sector parties to pool their  resources  for  accomplishing  a  strategic  investment  The  venture  is  its  own  legal  entity,  in  which each of the participants is responsible for its share in accordance with the prevailing  shareholding  structure  and  likewise  for  profits,  losses  and  costs  associated  with  it  Joint  Ventures operate in the commercial market, where GoR is a joint investor but not the sole  customer for the service provided    Public  Private  Partnerships (PPPs)  are  defined as  \"a  long-term  contract  between  a  private  party and a government entity, for providing a public asset or service, in which the private  party  bears  significant  risk  and  management  responsibility,  and  remuneration  is  linked  to  performance\"3   According to Law Nº 14/2016 of 02/05/2016 governing public private partnerships PPPs are  similarly  understood  as  a  broad  modality  to  procure  public  investments  with  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector,  potentially  leveraging  private  financing  and  technical  know-how to deliver the project The basic principle for PPPs is that risks are allocated to the  party best able to mitigate the respective risk, thereby arriving at an optimal risk allocation                                                           1  OECD, 2015, “Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises”

partnerships      3   Privatisation  of  public  enterprises  refers  to  transfer  of  ownership  and  control  of  government or state assets, firms and operations to private investors4   Privatisation, in the sense of this policy, encompasses the transfer of ownership of property  or businesses from the Government of Rwanda to a privately owned entity, hence aiming at  selling shares of (partly) state owned enterprises (SOE), including Joint Ventures    National Investment Program (NIP) is a consolidation of all public investment projects over  the medium term, which is either ongoing or planned (pipeline) Prerequisite for all projects  to be included in the NIP comprises is the approval by PIC  The pipeline section of the NIP  is  used  as  a  tool  to  coordinate  mobilization  of  external  resources  through  offering  well- prepared and economically viable projects   A Project is a set of activities over an established timeline and budget intended to achieve a  developmental  objective,  which  is  defined  through  outputs  According  to  this  policy  the  definition  also  comprises  ‘programmatic’  projects,  which  combine  smaller  projects  into  larger  investments  in  order  to  ease  planning  and  management  procedures  Projects  can  mainly be divided into capital investments and technical assistance development projects   Capital  Investment  entails  expenditure  targeting  the  acquisition  of  fixed  assets,  thereby  contributing  to  fixed  capital  formation  Potential  fixed  assets  comprise  eg  buildings  and  structures,  machinery  and  equipment  This  category  of  investment  also  includes  major  improvements  (renovations,  re-constructions  or  enlargements)  of  existing  fixed  assets  In  this  respect,  capital  investments  increase  the  performance  or  capacity  of  an  existing  fixed  asset  or  significantly  extend  it  beyond  the  previously  expected  service  life,  thereby  increasing the value of the asset   Technical  assistance  development  projects  comprise  sets  of  activities  focussed  either  on  social  transfers  or  on  capacity  development  /  knowledge  transfer  through  coordinated  programs consistent with Rwanda’s priorities   Contracting authority includes institutions engaging in a contract for goods or services such  as:  Ministries,  Agencies,  Districts,  City  of  Kigali  and  State  Owned  Enterprises  /  Public  Utilities   22  Scope of investment subjects covered    Against  the  backdrop  of  the  mentioned  objectives,  this  policy  mainly  deals  with  publicly  driven  investments  on  central  and  local  government  level  as  well  as  investments  of  commercial nature In theory, investments are defined as long-term commitment of funds in  real or in intangible assets Since the National Investment Policy also applies to development  assistance  programs  and  technical  assistance  projects,  as  included  in  the  development  budget, a broader understanding of investments is applied    In  that  sense,  the  policy  deals  on  the  one  hand  with  “public  investment”,  which  refers  to  capital investment in public goods, like physical assets / infrastructure (eg property, roads,                                                          4 OECD, 2002, “Glossary of Industrial Organisation Economics and Competition Law”      4   infrastructure  (eg  human  capital  government  buildings,  etc),  and  soft  assets  /  development, innovation support, research and development, etc) On the other hand, the  National  Investment  Policy  raises  strategic  ways  of  organizing  capital  expenditure  on  commercial  goods  and  businesses  This  means  investing  in  enterprises  involved  in  the  buying and/or selling of goods and/or services that are expected to generate positive cash  flows and/or beneficial effects for the development of key sectors in the Rwandan economy  The following figure shows the structure of investment goods covered            Figure 1:   Structure of investment options covered      Building upon this definition the National Investment Program shall cover all investments  in capital assets as well as in all developmental projects This means on the hand to include  all projects in the National Investment Program, which are listed in the development budget  and on the other hand to encompass all other investments, including shares and guarantees,  which may be budgeted for under recurrent expenditure    This approach serves the purposes of availing structured information on public investments  in  a  proven  manner,  to  inform  and  align  all  investment  decisions  by  government  and  to  allow for provision of credible data about the increase of Rwanda’s capital stock Following  this line of thinking means knowingly accepting that some projects or programs listed in the  National Investment Program will not be capital investments in the sense, that they do not  generate  gross  fixed  capital  formation  (GFCF),  which  as  such  has  to  last  longer  than  one  year,  with  measurable  return  on  the  invested  sum  This  applies  in  particular  to  technical  assistance projects   23  Funding Public Investments   In general, there are three sources for funding and financing public investments: i) Internal  funding sources, ii) external funding support and iii) borrowing as financing source with the  requirement to be paid back at least partly   5   Internal funding sources entail domestic tax and non-tax revenues, which are used to fund  the recurrent as well as the development budget    External funding support refers to Budget and Project Support from Development Partners  According to the Rwanda Aid Policy from 2006, Budget Support is the transfer of resources  from  a  Development  Partner  to  the  Rwandan  budget  The  same  lines  of  authority  and  procedures  that  govern  the  normal  Rwandan  budget  are  applicable  There  are  three  main  types  of  Budget  Support  in  Rwanda:  “General  Budget  Support”  is  defined  as  a  method  of  financing  the  GoR’s  national  budget  through  a  transfer  of  resources  from  a  donor  to  the  government  national  treasury  account  with  no  earmarking  to  a  sector  or  program  dealing  with  budget  allocation  “Sector  Support”  is  budget  support  provided  by  a  donor  with  the  aim  of  financing  the  realisation  of  development  objectives  in  an  identified  sector  “Budget  Support to Decentralization” is sector budget support for decentralized entities, channelled  through  Local  Administrative  Entities  Development  Agency  (LODA)  The  third  option  is  “Project  Support”,  which  is  directly  targeting  defined  sets  of  activities  under  the  development budget    Borrowing  is  used  for  the  recurrent  as  well  as  for  the  development  budget  It  can  be  differentiated  into  domestic  borrowing,  external  concessional  and  non-concessional  loans  (including  financing  via  capital  markets  issuing  bonds)  and  public  guarantees  If  a  loan  is  considered as concessional, depends on the share of a potential grant element and the terms  with regard to maturity and interest rates             6   3  Guiding principles of the National Investment Policy   Rwanda has come a long way in terms of improving public investment planning, budgeting  and  execution  In  order  to  further  improve  efficiency  of  the  investment  process  and  to  ensure attainment of investment objectives, there is a need to have a comprehensive look, on  how  to  strategically  approach  different  stages  of  investment  activity  as  well  as  on  how  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  public  investment  management  on  central  and  local government level    The following key principles will support the achievement of the objectives of the National  Investment Policy and will help to transform its logical framework into practice:   i  Alignment with national priorities Identification and selection of all projects shall  be  guided  by  national  priorities  laid  out  in  strategic  documents,  eg  the  National  Vision (to date Vision 2020), the National medium term strategy for development (to  date  EDPRS  2),  and  the  government  development  program  (to  date  7  Year  Government Program)   ii   Leveraging private sector Rwanda aspires to be a private sector led economy in line  with  the  Vision  2020  National  investments  will  as  much  as  possible  leverage  additional private sector financing    iii  Value  for  money  All  projects,  regardless  how  they  are  implemented,  shall  deliver  optimal  value  for  money  and  contribute  to  growth  by  maximizing  the  efficiency  through better selection, preparation and management of investments   Effectiveness  and  impact  orientation  The  selection  and  design  of  future  projects  shall  be  driven  by  systematically  assessed  experiences  about  achieved  impacts  and  lessons learnt from ongoing and completed projects   Efficiency  of  investments  This  will  be  achieved  by  ensuring  investment  selection  and  design  take  into  consideration  the  importance  of  reducing  fragmentation  and  scattering  of  resources  wherever  possible  while  increasing  complementarity  of  projects   Promotion  of  local  content  Investment  designs  and  selection  shall  consider  the  objectives  of  knowledge  transfer  and  promotion  of  the  local  economy,  especially  targeting the creation of local jobs as much as possible   Transparency  and  reliability  All  procedures  and  decisions  within  the  public  investment  management  shall  be  transparent  to  all  stakeholders  ensuring  a  sound  understanding and good predictability of resource allocation   viii   Sustainability:  investment  design  and  selection  will  be  driven  by  sustainability  considerations including long term environmental and social impacts among others   ix  Coordination  and  accountability  Roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  involved  stakeholders  shall  be  clearly  designed  to  ensure  coordination  across  sectors  and  government  levels  and  to  enable  all  institutions  to  plan  and  implement  effectively   iv   v   vi   vii      7   Investment  design  shall  integrate  accountability  mechanisms  in  different  forms  of  investment to ensure that intended objectives are achieved   x  Autonomous  decision   taking  by  Districts  Following   the  principle  of  decentralisation, investment  management  on the  level  of local  governments  will be  autonomous  as  provided  by  the  Decentralization  policy  For  purposes  of  coordination  across  the  country  central  government  institutions  will  provide  advisory and quality assurance support               8   4  Framework for the management of National Investments   41   Institutional framework, key stakeholders   Efficient and effective management of public

public investment process covers the project life cycle from identification and appraisal  via implementation up to ex-post evaluation Procedures targeted by the policy are designed  along  key  phases  of  the  public  investment  management  process,  reaching  from  initial  guidance up to evaluation feeding back into guidance for future projects:      12   Figure 2:   Key areas of the Public Investment Management Process5   421  Strategic Guidance for Investment Planning   Project identification will be guided by existing strategic documents to anchor government  decisions and to guide sector-level decision makers toward national priorities:      \\uf0b7  The National Vision (to date Vision 2020), the National medium term strategy  for  development  (to  date  EDPRS  2)  and  the  government  development  program  (to  date  7  Year  Government  Program)  will  be  the  most  important  strategies to orient the prioritization of investments    \\uf0b7  On  the  next  level  investment  planning  will  be  informed  by  macroeconomic  analysis  and  targets,  derived  from  the  government’s  macroeconomic  policy,  eg  sufficiency  of  investment  levels  as  percentage  of  GDP  with  regard  to  targeted  growth  rates,  appropriateness  of  the  cross-sectoral  distribution  of  investment  effects,  complementarity of public and private investments as well as conduciveness  for domestic and foreign investment   consideration   employment   taking   also   into   \\uf0b7  Within  sectors,  decisions  will  be  guided  by  sectoral  strategies  and  policies,   including eg industrial policy and agricultural strategy etc   \\uf0b7  Lastly, compliance with regional strategies and policies for example the EAC   Vision 2050 and the Agenda 2063 for Africa will be considered   National  Investment  Planning  is  informed  by  the  above  mentioned  guiding  documents  There  will  be  a  feedback  loop  from  investment  management  to  inform  these  higher-level  strategies as to their realism and feasibility                                                          5   See  A  Rajaram,  et  al  (2014)  The  Power  of  Public  Investment  Management  Transforming   Resources into Assets for Growth Washington DC World Bank, p 22      13   422  Appraisal   One  prerequisite  for  an  efficient  implementation  of  appropriate  investments  is  a  sound  preparation process To ensure that projects are adequately prepared to be delivered in time  and on budget, specific levels of appraisal are required, before a project will be considered  for implementation it will go through a thorough screening and appraisal process    Figure 3:   Thresholds for appraisal requirements      All  new  proposals  for  full-feasibility  or  project  implementation  will  have  to  be  submitted  with  a  project  profile  document  (PPD),  which  includes  basic  project  information,  and  an  additional  concept  note  describing  the  design  of  the  requested  project  (full-feasibility  or  investment)  to  ensure  that  the  project  is  accurately  costed  and  can  be  tendered  and  implemented in time and in budget Depending on the type of investment, its size and the  envisaged way of implementation different levels of appraisal are necessary, see Figure 3:   \\uf0b7  Pre-feasibility studies help to identify relevant alternatives before undergoing  a  full-fledged  feasibility  study  Pre-feasibilities  assess  a  project’s  readiness,  desirability,  viability  and  most  appropriate  form  of  implementation  The  intention  is  to  identify  and  exclude  unsuitable  projects  from  further  preparation  and  assessment  with  a  reasonable  input  of  resources  Pre- feasibility studies can be carried out internally without prior screening by an  Investment Committee   \\uf0b7  Feasibility  studies  will  be  used  to  assess  proposed  projects  in  detail  on  a  quantitative  basis  requiring  comprehensive  analysis  of  market  conditions,  technical, social, environmental, financial and economic issues depending on  the nature of the project in order to determine the optimal project design and      14   form of implementation Requests for feasibility studies have to be submitted  according  the  standard  planning  and  budgeting  guidelines  issued  by  MINECOFIN to be screened by the respective Investment Committee   The necessary scope of work of the studies required will be adapted to the specific nature of  projects and set out in guidelines, which will be published to support the implementation of  suggested policy measures The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN)  has the key function as quality assurer   423  Planning, budgeting and monitoring procedures on Central Government level   The description of processes at central level highlights the function of the Public Investment  Committee   Planning and Budgeting Process for Central Government Investments   The annual planning and budgeting cycle for central government projects, which covers the  steps of independent review and selection, is designed as follows:   \\uf0b7  The  planning  and  budget  cycle  on  central  government  level  officially  starts  with  the  issuance  of  the  1st  Planning  &  Budget  Call  Circular  (1st  PBCC)  by  MINECOFIN (NDPR) This document invites all Budget Agencies to propose  new  projects  for  funding  and  to  provide  information  on  ongoing  projects  with  regard  to  their  funding  needs  for  the  upcoming  (n)  and  the  two  following  fiscal  years  (n+1,  n+2)  The  issuance  of  the  circular  includes  templates  and  guidelines  on  how  to  prepare  and  provide  the  needed  information   \\uf0b7  MINECOFIN  (NDPR)  will  carry  out  a  first  screening  of  new  and  ongoing  projects  from  Central  Government  taking  into  consideration  the  state  of  preparation,  strategic  desirability  as  well  as  the  economic  and  financial  viability    \\uf0b7  Taking   into  consideration   from  planning  consultations,  MINECOFIN  (NDPR)  will  present  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  Public  Investment  Committee  (PIC),  which  will  determine  the  priorities  for  implementation of investments   resolutions   \\uf0b7  To initiate the budgeting process the 2nd Budget Call Circular is then issued   by MINECOFIN (NBD) Ceilings are informed by the findings of PIC   \\uf0b7  The  result  of  budget  negotiations  is  compiled  in  the  National  Investment   Program    \\uf0b7  Once  the  budget  is  approved  by  Parliament,  it  becomes  law,  and  each   Ministry may commit expenditure within the approved budgetary limits   Monitoring of contract and project management on Central Government level   Following  project  approval,  responsibility  for  project  implementation  will  pass  to  the  sponsoring  Budget  Agency  (BA)  The  Budget  Agency  is  responsible  for  implementing  the      15   project,  handling  contract  and  project  management,  while  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  is  in  charge of overseeing project execution MINECOFIN will monitor expenditure and physical  progress against budget approvals and implementation plans Generally, MINECOFIN will  report to Cabinet on progress against budget and planned implementation progress   Upon  closure  of  a  project,  a  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  Budget  Agency  and  approved  by  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  This  report  needs  to  provide  an  extensive  documentation  of  the  project,  including  information  on  physical  and  financial  execution,  achievement  of  outputs,  pending  activities,  challenges  and  recommendations  This  report  will  be  submitted  to  MINECOFIN  for  assessment  and  to  update  the  Public  Investment Management System   If  projects  generate  revenues  after  their  completion,  these  need  to  be  part  of  a  special  “operational  monitoring”  by  the  contracting  authority  delivering  reports  to  MINECOFIN  This  reporting  shall  ensure  that  these  projects  are  properly  monitored  and  that  associated  income flows into National Treasury’s accounts    424  Planning, budgeting and monitoring procedures on Local Government Level   LODA  and  of  the  Local  Government  Projects  Advisory  Committee  fulfil  key  functions  within the investment process at district level   Planning and Budgeting Process on local level   The planning and budget cycle for local governments follows the same pattern as the one for  central government    \\uf0b7  The planning and budget cycle officially starts with the 1st Planning & Budget   Call Circular for Local Governments issued by MINECOFIN     \\uf0b7  All project proposals will be submitted by Districts to MINECOFIN through   LODA   submitted  projects  LODA  will  present   \\uf0b7  LODA in collaboration with MINECOFIN  will carry out an initial  screening  of  all  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  Local  Government  Projects  Advisory  Committee  (LGPAC), which will advise on the priorities for investment District Councils  will review and approve investment decisions   its   \\uf0b7  After  the  District  Councils  decision,  LODA  and  MINECOFIN  consult  on  budget  ceilings  The  2nd  Budget  Call  Circular,  related  to  district  investment  plans, is then issued by MINECOFIN to begin the budgeting process on local  level   \\uf0b7   In accordance with the law No 62/2013 of 27/08/2013 establishing the Local  Administrative  Entities  Development  Agency  (LODA)  and  determining  its  mission,  organisation  and  functioning,  all  the  development  projects  implemented  by  decentralised  entities  shall  be  financed  through  LODA  to  increase efficiency and eliminate duplication  Within this process, LODA, in      16   collaboration with MINECOFIN, will hold consultations with each District in  order to finalise the budget proposals in the light of funding availability and  arrive  at  a  final  allocation  for  each  District  For  externally  funded  projects,  LODA will negotiate funds; the approved ones will be part of the projects to  be presented to LGPAC for quality assurance    \\uf0b7  LODA  submits  the  development  investments  and  corresponding  budget  to  the  Districts,  then  each  District  presents  its  development  projects  to  the  respective District Council The final budget is sent to Parliament, where it is  subject to the detailed scrutiny of the Budget Committee   \\uf0b7  Once the budget is approved by Parliament, it becomes law, and each District   may commit expenditure within the approved budgetary limits   Monitoring of contract and project management on local government level   The  Chief  Budget  Manager  of  the  respective  District  is  in  charge  of  overseeing  project  execution  LODA  will  track  expenditure  and  physical  progress  against  budget  approvals  and  implementation  plans    Generally,  LODA  will  report  to  Cabinet  via  MINECOFIN  on  progress against budget and stated outputs   Upon closure of a project, a project completion report will be prepared by  the District  and  approved  by  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  This  report  will  be  sent  to  LODA  for  assessment  and forwarded to MINECOFIN for updating the Public Investment Management System   The Chief Budget Manager shall ensure  that potential revenues from such investments are  properly  monitored  and  reported  on  and  that  associated  income  flows  into  the  Local  Government Consolidated Fund   425  Evaluation   Monitoring and evaluation are important management tools to track progress and facilitate  decision  making  Both  shall  provide  information  that  is  credible  and  useful,  enabling  the  incorporation  of  lessons  learned  into  the  planning  and  decision  making  process  While  monitoring  can  be  defined  as  a  continuing  function  that  aims  primarily  to  provide  the  management  and  main  stakeholders  of  an  ongoing  project  with  early  indications  of  progress,  or  lack  thereof,  in  the  achievement  of  results;  evaluation  is  the  systematic  and  objective  assessment  of  an  on-going  or  completed  project  with  regard  to  its  results  and  impacts at defined stages The aim is to determine the relevance and fulfilment of objectives,  investment  efficiency  and  effectiveness,  as  well  as  impact  and  sustainability  Stages  of  evaluation  that  matter  for  investment  projects,  depend  on  type,  size  and  sector,  these  are:  Ex-ante evaluation / ex-ante impact assessment, mid-term review, end-of-project evaluation,  ex-post evaluation (3-5 years after completion)   Evaluations  go  beyond  a  micro-economic  assessment  of  projects  and  therefore  require  enhanced preparatory works and an extended scope of work for institutions involved:   \\uf0b7  Properly worked out baseline;      17   \\uf0b7  Accurate description of chain from inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes to   impact;   \\uf0b7   Intervention  logic  of  projects  needs  to  be  properly  worked  out,  and  (at  minimum) put in a log frame (depending on project type);   \\uf0b7  Design of monitoring and evaluation functions with roles for Line Ministries,  independent   times)   MINECOFIN,  LODA,  Auditor  General,  and  evaluation    (at   Since  the  most  targeted  socio-economic  impacts  only  become  measurable  some  years  after  project completion, ex-post evaluation is a privileged type of evaluation among national and  multi-national  development  Banks  and  other  Investment  agencies  Whereas  ex-post  evaluation  of  single  investment  projects  comes  with  the  inconvenience  that  its  results  can  only inform future projects, it is a very important tool for investment programs, which are  rolled out over many years and locations   Complying  with  evaluation  requirements  is  international  best  practice  Therefore  an  assessment will be carried out to deliver a sound concept, how to adequately fit the logic of  evaluation of investment projects into the institutional setting tailored to Rwanda’s needs    Evaluations  for  central  government  projects  will  be  carried  out  or  commissioned  by  MINECOFIN or the executing Budget Agency For local government projects, the District or  LODA  may  commission  an  evaluation  Third  parties  may  also  conduct  an  evaluation  of  a  project with authorization of MINECOFIN    The  performance  of  strategically  important  projects  will  be  subject  to  evaluation  after  closure,  to  assess  their  outputs  against  the  targets  and  Key  Performance  Indicators  set  at  feasibility stage    Aims of the ex-post evaluation are to:   \\uf0b7  assess  how  well  individual  projects  are  achieving  the  targets,  especially  on   outcome and impact level, set for them at feasibility stage and   \\uf0b7  Systematically  collect  information  on  project  costs,  outputs  and  impacts  to   inform future project appraisals and improve the design of future projects            18   43  Selecting the suitable form of implementation of public investments   One  objective  of  the  National  Investment  Policy  lies  in  engaging  the  private  sector  and  leveraging  alternative  sources  of  financing  by  systematically  targeting  a  wider  range  of  strategic investment forms       Figure 4:   Matrix of investment forms   The matrix represents the landscape of (most) available forms of investment There are three  generally preferable vectors of evolution to be seen, which are indicated by the blue arrow:    (1) Considering scarcity of public domestic capital it is desirable to move to the right and to  unlock private commercial investments;    (2)  With  regard  to  technology  and  knowledge  transfer  it  is  attractive  to  stimulate  international  participation  in  investments  (the  four  lower  right  cells:  to  the  sorts  of  Joint  Ventures, international PPPs, consortia and FDI) and    (3)  Turn  upwards  and  target  the  whole  column  to  the  right,  aiming  at  a  substantially  growing share of Rwandan national companies    At  present,  the  Rwandan  economy  is  strong  in  the  left  column  [cells  (1),  (2)  and  (3)],  the  implementation  of  public  investments  with  either  public  funds  or  financial  aid  from  development  partners  The  next  step  for  the  economy  will  be  to  further  increase  the  investment share and involvement of the private sector and to identify innovative sources of  financing    With  regard  to  the  matrix,  this  means  targeting  the  middle  column  [cells  (4)  and  (5)]:  Applying  the  concept  of  PPPs  systematically  means  engaging the  private  sector,  including  foreign companies, to finance and deliver a specified public service or public infrastructure      19   An enhanced way of collaborating with the private sector will be Joint Ventures They will  be aiming at a more private sector driven approach to commercial investments limiting the  temporal  participation  of  the  government  by  agreeing  upon  clear  exit  and  risk  mitigation  options  The  possibility  to  strategically  withdraw  from  Joint  Ventures  forms  part  of  the  concept of privatisation, which generally covers the divestiture of shares in existing (partly)  state owned enterprises   431   Involving the private sector through PPP arrangements   PPPs are relatively new in Rwanda It is the objective of Rwanda to expand the application  of PPPs across sectors where they demonstrate potential for sustainable development gains  In  this  regard,  PPPs  are  seen  as  a  suitable  step  to  attract  further  domestic  and  foreign  investors  by  efficiently  sharing  inherent  project  risks  and  thereby  making  investing  in  the  provision of public goods and services more attractive for private partners   432  Founding State Owned Enterprises   Founding  new  state  owned  entities  shall  be  an  option  to  drive  economic  development  in  cases,  where  public  investment  is  needed  due  to  market  failure  causing  the  absence  of  private sector interest or where promising business cases in strategic sectors, like transport,  agriculture, manufacturing, etc, are too risky to be developed by the private sector Another  rationale  applies,  when  there  is  a  need  to  enhance  public  services  to  improve  the  population’s well-being (eg public utilities for water, electricity, sanitation…)   The  aim  founding  new  SOEs  should  be  to  create  an  environment  that  attracts  and  gives  confidence  to  the  private  sector  to  invest  (catalytic  investments)  Upon  the  market’s  readiness to invest, the State shall consider privatizing the entity by selling off its shares    433  Catalysing the development of private businesses through Joint Ventures   Joint  Ventures  are  meant  to  be  used  as  an  instrument  to  incentivize  and  drive  private  investments in strategic commercial markets with foreign and domestic partners, which are  seen as key to develop the Rwandan economy The rationale to promote Joint Ventures is to  tap  into  strategic  opportunities  and  to  encourage  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  into  strategic sectors   The  formulation  of  clear  exit  or  risk  mitigation  strategies  for  the  public  share  within  Joint  Ventures  will  be  part  of  all  investments  in  order  to  minimize  public  interventions  in  commercial  markets  Exceptions  can  be  useful,  where  there  is  a  special  public  strategic  interest and a further know-how as well as technology development is deemed necessary            20   44   Including PPPs, Joint Ventures and SOEs in public investment procedures   Based on the investment procedures outlined in chapter 42 specific arrangements for PPPs,  Joint Ventures and founding of SOEs are designed to include them in standard planning and  monitoring  procedures  The  aim  is,  firstly,  to  establish  PIC  and  LGPAC  as  mandatory  checkpoints  for  all  projects  in  order  to  increase  transparency  of  future  investments  and  alignment with national priorities Secondly, planning processes will be defined in a manner  that options to increase the participation of the private sector are systematically explored    Investments  planned  to  be  carried  out  as  PPPs,  Joint  Ventures  or  SOEs  require  a  pre- feasibility study as first step of preparation During their subsequent investment cycle, they  will pass four gateway procedures:   \\uf0b7  Step 1: Approval of full feasibility   \\uf0b7  Step 2: Approval of implementation   \\uf0b7  Step 3: Implementation and monitoring   \\uf0b7  Step 4: Ex-post evaluation (operation)    441  Need for approval by PIC or LGPAC during project preparation   At project preparation stage PPPs, JVs and SOEs need to be assessed twice by PIC or LGPAC  in order to obtain green light to proceed: In the first step, the approved request to conduct a  full  feasibility  study  is  compulsory  Going  ahead  before  starting  tender  procedures,  the  approved request for implementation of the project is required   The  corresponding  requests  need  to  be  prepared  in  line  with  the  general  planning  and  budgeting  procedures  The  sponsoring  Line  Ministry  or  District  will  compose  a  Project  Profile Document (PPD) complemented by the respective study, which will be submitted to  PIC for approval or LGPAC for non-objection via MINECOFIN or LODA   Adhering to the PPP Law, all findings and resolutions issued by the PIC regarding PPPs on  central level will be forwarded to the PPP Steering Committee for final decision The option  of calling a ministerial committee will also be available for other investments deemed to be  of strategical importance At local level, the LGPAC will advise on the quality of proposed  PPPs  and  make  recommendations  as  to  whether  they  require  the  attention  of  the  PPP  Steering Committee depending on their size and impact   In the course of budget planning and approval processes, options for required funding will  be  assessed  and,  if  agreed  upon,  the  respective  project  will  form  part  of  the  development  budget  approved  by  Parliament  Information  on  fiscal  obligations  for  GoR  arising  from  PPPs,  Joint  Ventures  and  Investments  in  SOEs  will  form  part  of  the  Budget  Framework  Paper   Following  these  steps,  involving  PIC  on  central  and  LGPAC  on  local  level  systematically,  will  open  the  possibility  to  promptly  capture  these  investments  within  the  Public  Investment  Management  System  and  to  build  a  credible  pipeline  of  projects  ready  for  feasibility  or  investment  funding  For  a  speedy  procedure  and  progress  of  strategic      21   investments,  PIC  and  LGPAC  will  convene  repeatedly  throughout  the  year  to  scrutinize  investment priorities in a timely manner   442   Implementation of PPPs   Following  project  approval,  responsibility  for  project  implementation  will  pass  to  the  sponsoring Budget Agency   Tendering and negotiation of PPPs   According  to  the  PPP  Law,  Rwanda  Development  Board  (RDB)  will  act as  lead  negotiator  during negotiations relating to a PPP agreement For a gateway and oversight function on  central level throughout the various stages of the procurement procedures the PPP Steering  Committee will be authorized to approve tender documents, selection of bidders (shortlisted  bidders) and processing of procurement up to selection of the preferred bidder (refer to the  Law Governing PPPs)   The District, LGPAC, or LODA may request RDB to assist with the negotiation of PPPs on  local level    To  ensure  prudent  debt  management,  information  about  the  details  of  the  financial  agreements  will  be  shared  with  and  assessed  by  MINECOFIN  The  affirmation  is  a  strict  precondition for signing the contract A formal request for a change of budget has to be filed  by the sponsoring Budget Agency when needed   Monitoring of PPPs   For PPPs, the sponsoring Budget Agency – line ministries and districts – will be responsible  for  monitoring  service  delivery  against  the  terms  set  out  in  the  Project  Agreement  Generally, according to the PPP Law monthly reports will be addressed to the PPP Steering  Committee    On a quarterly basis, the Budget Agency will be required to provide information on physical  progress and expenditure to MINECOFIN or LODA using standard report cards For PPPs  on  district  level,  LODA  will  check  and  consolidate  the  information  and  send  it  to  MINECOFIN    According to the standard monitoring procedures, MINECOFIN will screen and consolidate  information  on  PPPs  on  central  level  and  prepare  a  quarterly  report,  encompassing  PPP  projects on both levels This brief will be integrated into the overall project reporting to be  submitted to Cabinet for information and taking of necessary decisions    During their operational phase, PPPs shall be subject to a quarterly monitoring procedure by  the  contracting  authority  in  order  to  inform  MINECOFIN  on  compliance  with  contractual  obligations; this includes potential generation of revenues    At  District  Level,  the  Chief  Budget  Manager  shall  ensure  that  those PPP arrangements  are  monitored on a quarterly basis and reported to MINECOFIN (FDU) through LODA and that      22   associated  revenues  flow  into  the  Local  Government  Consolidated  Fund,  if  not  agreed  otherwise   443   Implementation of Joint Ventures   If the feasibility study indicates that a commercial project should be carried out partnering  with  a  private  investor  targeting  know-how  and  technology  transfer  and  if  the  requested  budgetary  means  are  approved,  then  the  project  will  be  marketed  and  promoted  by  the  respective Budget Agency or District    Since a Joint Venture is commercial in nature targeting mainly private and potentially public  customers, the initiation of Joint Ventures will follow a path deviating from common public  procurement  procedures  Usually,  mobilising  private  and  in  particular  foreign  investment  into  publicly  driven  investments  will  need  a  procedure  focused  on  communication  and  negotiation  with  potential  partners  In  pro-active  (industrial)  investment  planning  Public  Private  Dialogues  will  be  applied  in  order  to  obtain  concrete  matches  of  investment  intentions and required public support measures   The negotiation of Joint Ventures on Central Level will be supported by RDB RDB will take  over this task on Local Level, if requested by the specific District, LGPAC, MINECOFIN or  LODA  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  governance  structures  to  ensure  an  adequate  representation of the public party in the Board of Directors (or similar body)     To ensure sound financial management, JV agreements will be shared with and assessed by  MINECOFIN  The  affirmation  is  a  strict  precondition  for  signing  the  contract  A  formal  request  for  a  change  of  budget  has  to  be  filed  by  the  sponsoring  Budget  Agency  when  needed   Joint  Ventures  under  operation  (including  start-up  phase)  will  form  part  of  the  government’s portfolio of public shareholdings and will be monitored accordingly   444  State Owned Enterprises   If an investment is identified to be best implemented as a State Owned Enterprise (SOE), all  essential aspects of implementation will  need to be set out with the request for funding of  the initial capital This entails a detailed business model outlining organisational structures  as well as core and supportive procedures, which will guide the implementation through the  Budget Agency or District in charge    The  process  of  setting  up  and  running  an  SOE  will  be  subject  to  monitoring  of  public  shareholdings   45  Managing the portfolio of public shareholdings   451  Monitoring Shareholdings   The  Government  Portfolio  Management  Unit  within  MINECOFIN  and  LODA  will  be  responsible for monitoring the portfolio of existing and upcoming shareholdings on central  and local government level comprising Joint Ventures and SOEs Quarterly reports will be      23   drafted to inform public decision makers about the performance of public corporations On  annual  basis,  a  review  of  all  shareholdings  will  be  prepared  in  order  to  assess  the  composition of the existing portfolio against strategic targets    Amongst  others,  required  information  will  be  sourced  from  regular  company  reports  and  minutes  of  regular  board  and  annual  shareholders’  meetings  Reports  on  engagements  on  central  level  will  be  elevated  within  MINECOFIN  If  needed,  necessary  decisions  on  managing the entities will be taken by MINECOFIN    Quarterly  reports  about  shareholdings  on  district  level  and  respective  annual  reviews  will  be  compiled by  LODA  and  submitted to  MINECOFIN  via  the  Fiscal  Decentralization Unit  (FDU)  Necessary  decisions  regarding  the  management  of  public  companies  will  be  pre- agreed with the respective District Council and will then be approved by MINECOFIN   Decisions on changes in the structure of shares directly owned by GoR, either by selling or  buying,  will  need  to  be  additionally  screened  by  PIC  or  LGPAC  All  decisions  concerning  usual  business  operations  will  be  taken  by  the  company  management  team  following  company specific governance structures    The Autonomous Government Investment Body as one of GoR’s companies will take over a  special  role  in  the  management  of  GoR’s  shareholdings  by  pooling  and  managing  commercial  and  quasi-commercial  investments  of  government  It  will  be  governed  by  the  provisions  of  the  law  relating  to  companies;  it  will  have  full  commercial  discretion  and  flexibility to undertake investments, divestments and business decisions under the guidance  of  the  board  of  directors    MINECOFIN  will  have  the  responsibility  to  monitor  the  performance of the autonomous investment vehicle as one of GoR’s shareholdings   452  Portfolio Management (Privatisation Decisions)   The  institutions  in  charge  of  monitoring  public  shareholdings  will  support  the  strategic  management  of  the  public  shareholding  portfolio  by  analysing  and  recommending  adaptations to the compilation of the existing portfolio This assessment will be guided by  two overarching principles:  Firstly, considering limited public resources and the objectives  of  industrialization,  the  invested  shares  per  industrial  line  shall  reflect  the  strategic  importance of the particular sector Secondly, maximizing the private sector involvement in  order to become a private sector led economy   Bearing  in  mind  the  latter  principle  as  one  of  the  key  issues  of  the  national  investment  strategy,  the  Government  of  Rwanda  will  regularly  review  its  investments  in  public  corporations,  with  a  view  to  devising  a  program  to  expand  the  role  of  the  private  sector  This will be done in accordance with the privatisation law, the privatisation policy and the  Law Determining the Procedure for Disposal of State Private Assets    Requests  for  the  buying  or  selling  (privatisation)  of  shares,  including  infrastructure  managed  as  government  property  representing  a  business  opportunity,  can  be  filed  by  respective  Line  Ministries,  Districts  or  decision  taking  bodies  on  ministerial  level  These  requests need to comprise concept notes clearly outlining the rationale, social and economic      24   effects and implications for the state budget They will be screened by PIC for approval or  LGPAC  for  no-objection  and  will  then  be  elevated  for  decision  taking  to  Cabinet  or  the  Economic  Cluster  Decisions  concerning  entities  on  District  Level  will  be  pre-approved  by  the  specific  District  Council  Buying  and  selling  of  shares  under  the  Autonomous  Government Investment Body shall be subject to approval of the Board of Directors, which  then informs the shareholder (GoR) in line with usual reporting rules   The sale of central or local government interests in these corporations may vary depending  upon the most appropriate mechanism for particular enterprises, but as an objective, at least  some of their shares will be listed on the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE) via an initial public  offer (IPO) to broaden and deepen the capital market   46  Tracking Private Investments   The procedures and tools set out in the preceding section will apply to any project where the  Government  of  Rwanda  has  a  direct  financial  interest  –  ie,  conventional  public  sector  projects, PPPs and JVs    In addition, as part of the national investment policy, the Government of Rwanda will track  investment  in  private  sector  projects,  in  order  to  estimate  the  total  level  of  private  investment and monitor the growth of private investments against the targets set out in the  Vision 2020 and EDPRS   Responsibility for tracking private investments will fall to the Rwanda Development Board,  which shall share the information with MINECOFIN  The tasks to be undertaken by RDB to  track private investments are set out below   1  RDB  will  register  and  monitor  all  new  private  investments  RDB  already  performs  this  function  by  issuing  Investment  Certificates  to  new  investors,  and allocating an Aftercare Officer to provide support to each project once an  Investment Certificate has been issued   2  RDB  will  submit  quarterly  reports  to  MINECOFIN  on  forecast  levels  of   private investment   3  RDB  will  submit  an  annual  report  on  the  actual  estimated  level  of  private  investment in the previous year, drawing on surveys of investment actually  undertaken   4  All  projects  with  an  investment  value  exceeding  USD  2,000,000  will  be   identified within the RDB quarterly report to support economic planning            25   47  Managing key investment data   471  Establishing a Public Investment Management System (PIMS)   The  Integrated  Financial  Management  Information  &  System  (IFMIS)  will  be  expanded  to  also  serve  as  Public  Investment  Management  System  (PIMS),  a  customized  web-based  database  system  It  will  be  designed  to  prepare  a  proper  ground  for  the  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  public  investments  It  shall  be  upgraded  from  time  to  time  to  keep  it  abreast with current developments  The PIMS will contain four essential modules:   Pipeline  Module:  Projects  approved  by  the  investment  committees,  which  have  not  obtained funding in the current fiscal year will be considered for funding in the following  financial  year  These  investments  will  be  systematically  recorded  in  the  pipeline  module  according to their preparation status (eg “ready for feasibility funding”, “under appraisal”,  “ready for investment”) By this means a reliable and transparent pipeline of sound project  concepts will evolve, including projects targeted to be carried out as PPPs, Joint Ventures or  SOEs By passing through the screening process, it will be ensured that all listed projects /  investments  have  sound  information  showing:  a  convincing  concept,  their  feasibility  and  strategic alignment, representing key sectors targeted by the government   This pipeline shall be used as reliable source for a pro-active marketing of projects by either  RDB  or  MINECOFIN  or  Line  Ministries,  when  looking  for  investors  or  external  funding  sources    Project Module: This module facilitates the registration, screening / selection and allocation  of  funds  during  annual  budgeting  as  well  as  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  projects  Budget  Agencies  shall  use  this  module  via  a  web-based  interface  to  register  and  submit  projects for screening /selection during the annual planning and budgeting cycle To ensure  a simple and clear identification of projects during their lifetime, all projects will be given a  unique code   The data captured will be focussing on general project information and details on financing  and outputs To emphasize the importance of medium term expenditure projections both for  investment  and  financing  decisions,  the  database  will  be  structured  to  comprise  a  breakdown  of  cost,  including  maintenance  and  operation  cost,  and,  if  applicable,  revenue  estimations  To  facilitate  the  strategic  management  and  monitoring  of  the  investment  portfolio, this module will include all types of projects Investments in form of JVs and SOEs  will be captured up to the selection stage and the approval for implementation From then  on JVs and SOEs will be managed as part of the portfolio of public shareholdings   PPP Module: This module will capture details about the implementation of Public Private  Partnership (PPP) projects The purpose will be to support tracking, managing and reporting  on all PPPs   Reporting Module: This module will avail management reports and executive summaries of  information captured in PIMS to facilitate decision making It shall be flexible to create and  generate analytical reports according to specific purposes      26   The PIMS shall be linked to other government databases, to facilitate swift information flow  and enhance efficiency in the delivery of public investment projects, eg the M&E Database  for  projects  on  local  level,  the  Public  Debt  Management  System  and  National  Bank  Information  Systems  The  PIMS  shall  be  made  accessible  to  all  public  institutions,  which  perform any role in process of delivery of public investment or capital expenditure Staff of  budget  agencies  shall  be  given  user  IDs  and  passwords  with  the  relevant  restrictions  for  various uses   472  Documentation as audit trail   To  ensure  probity  and  transparency  in  the  use  of  public  funds,  in  any  case  where  public  investment  is  committed  to  projects,  whether  directly  or  via  a  PPP  or  Joint  Venture  agreement,  the  project  cycle  will  be  documented  by  a  full  audit  trail  from  inception  to  completion within the Public Investment Management System            27   Annex I:   Implementation Plan   Objective  Awareness about  National Investment  Policy raised   Activity  Produce distributable version of  National Investment Policy and  disseminate to stakeholders  Explain innovations of policy in  regular trainings for planning  officers and in sector meetings on  project execution  Include module on National  Investment Policy in trainings  designed to support the  implementation of the PPP Law  Guidelines for Pre-Feasibility and  Feasibility Studies   Guidelines for the appraisal of  PPP projects  Preparation of trainings around  developed guidelines  Develop a capacity building plan  for project managers

What  kind  of  society  do  they  want  to  become?  How  do  they  construct  a  united  and  inclusive  Rwandan identity? What are the transformations needed to emerge from  an  unsatisfactory  social  and  economic  situation?  These  are  the  main  questions Rwanda Vision 2020 addresses  Vision 2020 was a result of a national consultative process that took place  in Village Urugwiro between 1998-1999 There was a broad consensus on  the necessity for Rwandans to clearly define the future of the country  This process provided the basis upon which this Vision was developed   Since  then  Rwanda  has  made  much  progress  towards  attaining  these  objectives and even surpassed some of the targets In 2011, with less than  10 years towards the realization of the Vision, it was necessary to assess  the relevance of the indicators and targets and ensure that they continue  to reflect the ambition and the progress of the country towards attaining  its  long  term  development  goals  This  culminated  in  a  revision  of  the  original  Vision  2020  targets  through  a  consultative  process  where  the  revised targets were adopted at the 9th Leadership retreat in February  2012 The original Vision 2020 contained 47 indicators and targets, which  have been revised to a total of 48  The guiding rationale for the revision was based on the following:  1  Aligning  targets  to  level  of  low  middle  income  countries:  an  analytical comparison has been made of Rwanda and middle income  countries and adjustments made where necessary The most notable  change  is  the  adjustment  of  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  per  capita to meet the changing thresholds of middle income countries  The existing Vision 2020 target for GDP per capita has been revised  from USD 900 to USD 1240 The current threshold for lower middle  income countries is USD 1,006 to USD 3,975, upper middle income;  USD 3,976 to USD 12,275; and high income; $12,276 or more Meeting  this target will ensure Rwanda moves into the lower middle income  category by 2020   2  Harmonizing  with  the  more  ambitious  seven  year  government  program (7YGP) targets: Some 7YGP targets were found to be more  ambitious  than  those  contained  in  the  Vision  2020  These  include   1  among others; the target for percentage of population below poverty  line which is 20% in 7YGP while it was 30% in Vision 2020; the target  for access to electricity in 7YGP which is at 70% while it was 35% in  the Vision 2020   3   Inclusion of indicators and targets for climate change, governance,  ICT  and  regional  integration:  The  Vision  2020  already  considered  these as important areas in the six pillars; this is now reinforced with  high  level  indicators  such  as;  biodiversity,  citizen  satisfaction  with  service delivery and rule of law, and the degree of openness reflected  by the proportion of trade to GDP    4  Some  targets  already  achieved  requiring  more  ambition:  out  of  the  original  47  indicators  in  the  Vision  2020,  12  (26%)  are  already  achieved and 16 (34%) are well on-track to be achieved among which  average GDP growth rate, agricultural production (kcal/day/person),  infant  mortality  rate,  secondary  school  transitional  rate,  malaria- related mortality, admission rate to tertiary education among others  More ambitious targets have been set for the set of indicators already  achieved  2  2 CURReNT SITUATION AND THe CHALLeNGeS  21 Historical perspective  Although  Rwanda  has  made  significant  progress  from  the  devastation  that marked the nation in the immediate aftermath of the 1994 genocide  against  the  Tutsis,  it  still  remains  with  significant  challenges  amongst  which  are  449  %  of  the  population  still  living  under  the  poverty  line  In  order  to  fully  understand  the  present  situation,  it  is  important  to  appreciate Rwanda in a historical perspective  Since the 11th century, Rwanda existed as a nation founded on a common  history  of  its  people,  shared  values,  a  single  language  and  culture,  extending well beyond the current borders of the country The unity of  the  Rwandan  nation  was  also  based  on  the  clan  groups  and  common  rites with no discrimination based on ethnicity  The  colonial  power,  based  on  an  ideology  of  racial  superiority  and  in  collaboration  with  some  religious  organizations,  exploited  the  subtle  social  differences  and  institutionalized  discrimination  These  actions  distorted the harmonious social structure, creating a false ethnic division  with disastrous consequences  The history of Rwanda can be summarized by the following key events:  •\\t The 1884 Berlin Conference  placed  the Kingdom  of Rwanda  under   German  rule as part of Deutsch Ostafrica (German East Africa);  •\\t During the subsequent partition of Africa in 1910, a big part of Rwanda  was annexed to neighboring countries This caused the loss of 1/3 of  the Rwandan internal market and a large part of its natural resources;  •\\t Following  the  1st    World  War  and  the  defeat  of  Germany,  Rwanda  was given to Belgium as a trustee territory under the authority of the  League of Nations;  •\\t After    the    2nd      World  War,  the  League  of  Nations    became  the  United  Nations  and  Rwanda  became  a  UN  Mandate  trust  territory,  under Belgian administration, until 1962;  •\\t During  the  colonial  period,  the  Belgian  administration  applied  contemporary Darwinian theories, thereby deeply dividing the people  of Rwanda This unfortunate development can be seen as laying the  foundations for periodic mass killings even after independence was  gained in 1962, culminating in the 1994 genocide  3  •\\t The RPF put an end to the 1994 genocide and thereafter formed the  Government  of  National  Unity  (GNU)  and  the  Transitional  National  Assembly (TNA) in coalition with other political parties to define a  new future for Rwanda through democratic institutions  This  historical  legacy  goes  some  way  to  explain  the  challenges  that  Rwanda faced back in 2000 when the initial Vision 2020 was elaborated  some of which remain while others have been overcome  22 Major challenges facing Rwanda today  The economy of Rwanda is currently characterized by internal (budget  deficit) and external (Balance of Payments) macroeconomic disequilibria,  alongside low savings and investment rates and high unemployment and  underemployment  (table  1)  In  addition,  Rwanda’s  exports,  composed  mainly of tea, coffee and minerals – whose prices are subject to fluctuations  on the international market – have not been able to cover imports needs  Table 1: Rwanda’s Macro-economic indicators from 1995 to 2011  Indicators Price Levels  (%)  CPI (eop) GDP Deflator  Without grants With grants  Real GDP growth Internal absorption (%GDP) Overall  budget  deficit (%

 5401 5927 50   59  4  This  overall  situation  can  be  best  explained  by  reviewing  a  number  of  constraints at the level of the economy;   Low agricultural productivity and narrow economic base: Agriculture  accounts for more than 716% (2010) of the labour force, yet remains on  a relatively high subsistence level with low productivity The agricultural  productivity  and  production  has  increased  significantly  since  2000  though there is room for tapping potentials in modernization and value  addition However, Rwandans cannot afford total dependency on farming;  strategies will be devised to move the economy into the secondary and  tertiary sectors It is clear that increases in the productivity and exports  of  Coffee  and  Tea  alone,  will  not  be  sufficient  to  build  the  Rwandan  economy Therefore efforts need to be made to expand and diversify the  economic base especially exports  Natural  barriers to trad e: Rwanda is landlocked, with long distances  from ocean ports; a factor that raises transportation costs for both exports  and imports The country lacks a link to regional railway networks, which  means most trade is conducted by road Poor quality of road infrastructure  linking  Rwanda  to  other  countries  creates  high  transportation  costs  leading  to  inflated  prices  of  domestically  manufactured  products,  and  raising the price of raw materials imported for manufacturing   Low level of human  resource  development: Since the elaboration of  the  Vision  2020,  Rwanda  has  taken  important  strides  in  tackling  the  prevalence of Malaria and halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS  The key population and health issues to be addressed remain malnutrition  and the emergence of non-communicable diseases Significant progress  has been made in tackling illiteracy and ensuring universal access to basic  education The major challenges faced in human resource development  are in developing technical and vocational skills that match labour market  needs and continuing to develop a strong base of science, technology  and innovation graduates to spearhead the move into global and regional  markets   Low infrastructure development: Rwanda has made strong governance  reforms  of  doing  business,  however,  the  major  challenge  remains  in  reducing the infrastructure-related cost of doing business especially the  high cost of electricity and low level of energy production With electricity  generation at almost 100MW, a significant step up in energy investment  with increased private sector participation will be required to meet the  targets for increased manufacturing and industrialization   5  3 MAJOR OBJeCTIVeS OF VISION 2020  The Vision seeks to fundamentally transform Rwanda into middle - income  country by the year 2020 This will require achieving per capita income of  US$1240 from US$595 in 2011; a poverty rate of 20% from 449% in 2011;  and an average life expectance of 66 years from 49 years in 2000  Taking into account the scarcity of resources, prioritization, sequencing  and enhanced coordination will be crucial This section shows prioritization  and  acknowledges  the  interdependencies  and  complementarities  between different policies and developments For example, industry and  service  sector  development  cannot  be  realized  without  a  competitive  stock of skills, infrastructure and financial services  31  Macroeconomic  stability and wealth creation to reduce aid    dependency  Rwanda  will  continue  on  its  path  to  put  in  place  macroeconomic  stabilization policies that are conducive for private sector development  This, together with a fiscal consolidation strategy aiming at expanding  the domestic resource base while rationalizing spending, and increasing  exports, is the only way to lessen aid dependence  The imbalances highlighted in Table 1 have been a source of macroeconomic  instability  and  dependency  on  foreign  aid  To  reduce  this  dependency  it will be crucial to develop effective strategies to expand the tax base  and attract foreign investors Also, there is need to continue aggressive  diversification and the development of non-traditional exports  Government  will  focus  on  private  sector  development,  desisting  from  providing services that the private sector can deliver more efficiently and  competitively With the policies in place, the economy will be able to take  up the challenge of transforming into a knowledge-based society  32 Structural economic transformation   Even  if  Rwanda’s  agriculture  is  transformed  into  a  high  value/high  productivity  sector,  it  will  not,  on  its  own,  become  a  sole  engine  of  growth In the last decade, the share of industry and services to GDP has  increased from 14% and 44% in 2000 to 16% and 46% in 2011 respectively   Transforming Rwanda’s economy will require increasing investments in  industries and services In addition to this reliance on unproductive and   6  subsistence agriculture would give place to highly productive agriculture  leading to agro-processing, industry development and exports The issue,  however, is not simply one of a strategy based on agriculture, industry  or services, but rather, identifying Rwanda’s comparative advantage and  concentrating  strategies  towards  it  A  rich  supply  of  labour,  a  large   multilingual  population,   and  strategically   located   as  the  gateway   between    East    and  Central  Africa  makes  it  advantageous  for  intra- regional infrastructure The industries established will need to address  basic  needs,  for  which  there  is  a  readily  available  market,  as  these  products can satisfy local demand and even move towards export  As for services, this sector  will become  the most important  engine  of  Rwanda’s economy Since Rwanda is landlocked and has limited natural  resources,  the  Government  will  continue  supporting  policies  geared  towards encouraging investment in services, to acquire and maintain a  competitive edge in the region  It  should  be  noted  that  the  elaboration  of  such  policies  will  not  be  suffi  cient  to  achieve  a  knowledge-based  economy    Continuous  investment  in  infrastructure  will  be  required  mainly  in  energy  and  transport to reduce the cost of doing business Improvements  in  quality  of education and health will be crucial for providing an effi  cient and  productive workforce  Figure 1: Transformation of economic activity 2011 - 2020  7  33 Creating a productive middle class and fostering          entrepreneurship  The  development  process  and  capital  formation  cannot  –  in  the  long  run  – be achieved by the state or by donor funds alone While both of  these must contribute, the backbone of the process should be a middle  class of Rwandan entrepreneurs  Productive entrepreneurship  must be  fostered  to perform its  traditional  role  of creating wealth, employment  and vital innovations through opportunities for profit  Stimulating   the   private   sector,   particularly   with   regard   to  the    promotion   of  exports   and competitiveness is not achievable without  broadening and deepening the  financial sector such as banking,  insurance,  capital market and  the  application  of  information  technology  Provision  of high quality educational services will be necessary for consolidating  development gains made in the last 10 years Rwanda aims to find a niche  market  in  the  region  by  becoming  a  logistics,  telecommunication  and  financial hub  It  is  envisaged  that  with  these  reforms,  Rwanda  will  transform  from  a  subsistence agricultural economy to a knowledge-based society, with a  vibrant class of entrepreneurs The following section outlines the major  pillars of this vision and its key components  8  4 THe PILLARS OF VISION 2020  This section focuses on the key aspects of Vision 2020 that have been  discussed so far and addresses them individually  This section will also  examine six “Pillars” through which the aspirations of Vision 2020 will be  realized  Table 2: Pillars of Vision 2020 and its cross-cutting areas  Pillars of Vision 2020  Cross-cutting areas of Vision 2020  1   Good governance and a capable   state  2  Human resource development and   a knowledge-based economy  1   Gender equality  3   A private sector-led economy  4   Infrastructure development  2   Protection of environment and   sustainable natural resource  management   5  Productive and market-oriented   agriculture  6  Regional and  international   economic integration  3   Science and technology, including   ICT  41 Good governance and a capable state  Rwanda will become a modern, united and prosperous nation founded  on the positive values of its culture  The nation will be open to the world,  including its own Diaspora  Rwandans will be a people, sharing the same  vision for the future and ready to contribute to social cohesion, equity  and equality of opportunity  The  country  is  committed  to  being  a  capable  state,  characterized  by  the  rule  of  law  that  supports  and  protects  all  its  citizens  without  discrimination  The  state  is  dedicated  to  the  rights,  unity  and  well- being of its people and will ensure the consolidation  of the nation and  its security  Social  and  economic  transformation  is  as  much  about  states  as   9  markets  In  effect,  the  role  of  the  state  is  indispensable  for  wealth- creation and development Capacity building has been one of the biggest  Government  priorities  to  ensure  the  development  and  deployment  of  public  sector  skilled  human  resources,  who  grasp  the  needs  of  other  sectors – in particular the private sector – and can translate them into  sound policies and strategies However more efforts are needed in that  area to increase citizens’ satisfaction with service-delivery We need an  effective,  dynamic public sector that can lay the foundations for Rwanda  to be competitive in the modern international economy  The  State  will  ensure  good  governance,  this  includes;  accountability,  transparency  and  efficiency  in  deploying  scarce  resources  But  it  also  means  a  State  respectful  of  democratic  structures  and    processes,   committed  to the  rule  of law  and  the  protection  of human  rights  in  particular  Participation  at  grassroots  level  will  continue  to  be  promoted  through  the decentralization process, whereby local communities are empowered  through their involvement in the decision making process, enabling them  to address the issues that considerably affect them  The  reconstruction  of  the  nation  of  Rwanda  and  its  social  capital,  anchored on good governance and an effective  and  capable  state,  is   considered  a  basic  condition  to  stimulate  a  harmonious development  of other pillars1  42 Human resource development and a knowledge-based economy  from   Apart  improving  the  general  welfare  of  the  population,  improvements in  education  and  health services can be used to build a  productive and efficient workforce  This will be essential for Rwanda  to become a sophisticated knowledge-based economy  education  Rwanda  has  made  tremendous  steps  towards  ensuring  “Universal  Education for All”, one of the most important Millennium Development  Goals,  through  the  nine  year  basic  education  program  now  moving  to  twelve years Rwanda will continue to focus on challenges in quality of  education, matching of skills to labour market needs and entrepreneurial  mindset shift   1  It  cannot  be  stressed  enough  however  that  the  6  pillars  and  3  cross  cutting  areas  have  to  be  developed in tandem – indeed this was the main message of section 3   10  Major emphasis will continue to be placed on vocational and technical  training in the fields of technology, engineering and management This  will  be  targeted  at  secondary  and  tertiary  levels,  as  well  as  various  sections  of  society  (with  particular  emphasis  on  youth  and  women)  To  encourage  skills  development,  micro-credit  schemes  will  continue  to be promoted specifically to extend finance to young, self-employed  technicians  Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  innovative,  small-scale  entrepreneurs  To  promote  efficiency  and  continuous  upgrading  of  skills,  large  scale  employment  creation  programs  will  be  launched  in  the national institutions aimed at on-job-training, in-service training and  distance learning  Rwanda lags behind in professional training, with shortages in the fields of  applied and natural sciences and ICT Although the country will continue  to  rely  on  imported  technology  from  advanced  countries,  well-trained  specialized nationals will be essential to the running and maintenance of  technological systems, ranging from medicine and agriculture to industry  and telecommunications   One crucial element to the achievement of Vision 2020 will be to ensure  a proper link between education policies and sector development and  labour  policies  It  is  crucial  to  understand  that  the  investment  needed  for  the  development  of  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  will  not  be  effective without a suitably skilled labour force  Health and population  The  Rwandan  population  was  estimated  at  about  8  million  people  in  2000 with one of the highest population densities in Africa and a high  population  growth  rate  close  to  3%  per  annum  With  a  population  estimated at 108 million in 2011, Rwanda remains with one of the highest  population densities in Africa   Rwanda   considers   its  population   as  its  fundamental   resource   and   banks   on  it  for   its  future development With the success of current  and  future  population  policies,  Rwanda  projects  to reduce the fertility  rate within the remaining 9 years from  46 (2010)  to 3 children in 2020  and  the  population  growth  from  about  3%  (in  2000)  to  22%  (  in  2020)  Although tremendous progress has been made with regard to the  state  of  health of  the  Rwandan population, with an impressive drop in HIV  prevalence (from 13% in 2000 to 3 % in 2011) and reduction in incidence of   11  endemic diseases (malaria and TB); challenges remain with malnutrition  and the increase of non-communicable diseases; campaigns to eradicate  malnutrition amongst children will be emphasized and to raise awareness  of prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases Addressing  the shortage of specialized health personnel and improving the quality  of  health  care  will  be  the  focus  of  health  policy  while  continuing  the  successes of home grown solutions like the community health workers  model   In  addition,  health  policies  will  continue  to  be  targeted  at  the  poorest  members  of  the  population  to  improve  quality,  and  both  geographical  and financial accessibility to healthcare Family planning remains crucial  for  controlling  population  growth  Envisaged  and  current  population  policies will go hand in hand with strategies to overcome problems in the  health sector   43 Private sector-led development  For Rwanda’s development, the emergence of a viable private sector that  can take over as the principle growth engine of the economy is absolutely  key  Not  only  will  such  a  development  be  conducive  for  economic  growth, but it will also ensure the emergence of a vibrant middle class  of entrepreneurs, which will help develop and embed the principles of  democracy  Although  foreign  direct  investment  will  be  encouraged,  a  local-based business class remains a crucial component of development  The  Government  of  Rwanda  will  foster  private  sector  development  as  a  catalyst;  ensuring  that  infrastructure  (specifically  IT,  transport  and  energy), human resources and legal frameworks are geared towards to  stimulating economic activity and growth of private investments  The continued development of the financial sector remains crucial with  an increasing number of people accessing financial services The financial  sector must be able to provide the necessary capital for private sector  development The government aims to promote local business through  the introduction of industrial parks and export processing zones in which  foreign operators could partner with local businesses  Particular attention will be paid to the labour market  More than 10 years  into the implementation of Vision 2020, the Rwandan economy has been  able to generate 12 million non-farm jobs  With population expected  to  reach  around  135  million  by  2020  and  at  least  half  the  population  depending on off-farm activities, it will therefore be necessary to create   12  16 million off-farm jobs This will require a substantial number of jobs  created in the private sector  44 Infrastructure development  The  development  of  infrastructure  is  a  crucial  aspect  in  lowering  the  costs  of  doing  business  in  Rwanda,  which  is  essential  to  attracting  domestic and foreign investments  Land use management  Land use management is a fundamental tool in development As Rwanda  is characterized by acute land  shortage,  a  land  use  plan  has been  developed    to    ensure    its    optimal    utilization    in    urban    and    rural  development    Currently,  Rwanda’s  scarce  land  resources  still  face  a  challenge of ineffective translation of the developed land use master plan  into sector strategic plans and district development plans In the coming  years, Rwanda will ensure that every development plan is guided by the  land use master plan The recent land tenure regularization will increase  security on ownership and improve productive land usage    Rwanda will continue to pursue a harmonious policy of organized grouped  settlements (umudugudization) Rural settlements organized into active  development centres will be further equipped with basic infrastructure  and services While this system of settlement will continue to serve as an  entry point into the development of non-agricultural income generating  activities, land consolidation will be emphasized so as to create adequate  space for modern and viable farming  Urban development  By  2020,  each  town  will  have  updated  urban  master  plans  with  coordinated implementation of the plans The country will develop basic  infrastructure in urban centres and in other development poles, enabling  the decongestion of agricultural zones The proportion of those living in  towns and cities will increase from 148% in 2010 to 35% in 2020 (and 10%  in 2000) The income differential between towns and rural areas should  remain  within  reasonable  proportions,  due  to  the  decentralization  of  economic activities throughout the country  13  Transport  Rwanda  is  landlocked  with  high  transport  costs  to  the  ocean  ports   of  Kenya  and Tanzania Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternative  lower  costs  of  transport  to  the  sea,  notably  through  a  regional  rail  extension to Isaka, Tanzania and an extension to the Ugandan Railway  system  Furthermore, a second airport capable of serving, as a regional  hub for the great lakes region will be developed For the internal market,  Rwanda  has  a  reliable  and  safe  transport  network  of  feeder  roads;  however, these will continue to be maintained, extended and improved  Communication & ICT  Rwanda has made a rapid improvement in ICT with fibre optic network  coverage all through the country, mobile telephone network coverage at  almost 100%, with 45% mobile subscriptions in 2011 By 2020, Rwanda  projects  to  have  internet  access  at  all  administrative  levels,  for  all  secondary schools and for a large number of primary schools Telephone  services will be widespread in rural areas and efficiency of public services  will have increased through the application of e-government principles  It is expected that mobile subscription will reach 60% and the number of  internet users will reach at least 50 % (from 43% in 2010)  energy  Inadequate and expensive electricity supply constitutes a limiting factor  to development Wood is the main source of energy for 863% (2010) of  the population down from 99% in 2000 which is a significant drop This  leads to massive deforestation and soil destruction  Imported petroleum  products  consume  more  than  17%  of  foreign  exchange  Rwanda  will  therefore  increase  energy  production  and  diversify  into  alternative  energy sources  To  achieve  this,  Rwanda  has  considerable  hydroelectric  potential,  in  addition  to  large  deposits  of  renewable  methane  gas  in  Lake  Kivu,  estimated at 60 billion cubic meters In rural areas direct solar energy or  photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155 million tons of  peat deposit is currently exploitable  Rwanda  projects  that  by  2020,  at   least  75%  of  the  population  will be connected to electricity (up from  2% in 2000 and 11% in 2010) and the consumption of wood will decrease  from the current 863% to 50% of national energy consumption  14  Water  In  2010,  742%  of  Rwandans  have  access  to  clean  water  The  country  is  endowed  with  reserves  that  could  provide  enough  water  for  both  consumption and agricultural purposes These include substantial rainfall  (between 900 & 1500 mm per year) and the abundance of lakes, streams  and  watercourses  Furthermore,  there  is  an  abundant  supply  of  high  altitude water in the western part of the country, which may be used in  providing water by gravity to the southern and south-eastern regions of  the country that face water shortages Rwanda will continue to invest in  protection and efficient management of water resources, as well as water  infrastructure  development  to  ensure  that  by  2020  all  Rwandans  have  access to clean water   Waste management  The transmission of various water- borne diseases can be attributed to  the consumption of dirty and contaminated water The unplanned and  disorganized construction of towns without a suitable drainage system  exacerbates  sanitary  problems  Sewerage  and  rainwater  can  destroy  public roads or stagnate, creating ideal breeding grounds for both human  and animal diseases Since most houses are situated on the summit and  on the slopes of hills, water sources are in constant danger of pollution  by domestic sewerage and other human activities carried by the stream  of  water  The  environmental    impact    and    waste    management    has  recently been  taken  into  account  by  human settlements and industrial  installations, but challenges remain  By 2020, the rural and urban areas are to have sufficient sewerage and  disposal systems Each town is to be endowed with an adequate unit for  treating solid wastes Households will have mastered and be practicing  measures of hygiene and waste disposal  45 Productive high value and market oriented agriculture  Since  independence,  Rwanda’s  economic  policies  have  targeted  agriculture as the main engine of economic growth Though agriculture  productivity has been increasing in the recent years, there is still room for  improvement It will be necessary to continue with the implementation  of aggressive transformational policies that move towards a modern and  more productive agriculture  15  Agricultural  policy  orientation  will  continue  to  focus  on  promoting  intensification so as to increase productivity, promoting value addition,  modernization and improved quality of livestock to achieve an average  annual growth rate of 85% The vision aims to replace subsistence farming  by a fully, commercialized agricultural sector by 2020  46 Regional and international integration  Rwanda  considers  regional  economic  integration  as  one  of  the  crucial  elements  of  achieving  Vision  2020  To  this  end,  Rwanda  will  continue  pursuing  an  open,  liberal  trade  regime,  minimizing  barriers  to  trade  as  well  as  implementing  policies  to  encourage  foreign  direct  investment  Furthermore,  policies  to  promote  competitive  enterprises,  exports  and  entrepreneurship  will  be  emphasized  Economic  zones  for  ICT  based  production  will  be  crucial  for  enhancing  competitiveness  of  Rwandan  firms  The  vision  of  accessing  larger  regional  markets  will  be  accompanied  through a program of investing in infrastructure to promote Rwanda as  a  logistics,  telecommunication  and  financial  hub  Furthermore,  taking   advantage  of  Rwanda’s  comparative  strategic  position  should  be   exploited    in    terms    of  warehouse  functions    in  trade  and  commerce  Export  processing  zones,  coupled  with  the  industrial  reforms  noted  above,  will  enable  the  country  to  consolidate  its  niche  in  services,  communication  and  financial  sectors  and  take  advantage  of  growing  regional co- operation in the Great Lakes/ Eastern African Region  16  5 CROSS-CUTTING ISSUeS OF VISION 2020  Alongside  the  6  pillars,  there  are  three  cross-cutting  areas  of  gender,  environment and climate change; and science and technology   51 Gender equality  Women make up 53% of the population and participate in subsistence  agriculture  more  than  men  They  usually  feed  and  provide  care  for  their children and ensure their fundamental education There has been  tremendous progress in gender equality specifically in education (as the  number of girls in primary and secondary education has surpassed boys  with girls to boys ratio at 103) and in decision making positions (as of  2012 women represent about 56% of parliamentarians)  In order to strengthen gender equality and equity, Rwanda will further  update and adapt its laws on gender It will continue to support education  for all, fight against poverty and practice a positive discrimination policy  in favour of women with a focus in TVET, tertiary level and in employment  opportunities Gender will continue to be integrated as a cross-cutting  issue in all development policies and strategies at both central and local  government levels  52 Natural resources, environment and climate change  To date, climate change is widely recognized as the major environmental  problem  facing  the  globe  that  is  becoming  inextricably  linked  to  development  Rwanda  is  increasingly  facing  global  climate  change  consequences including; flooding, resulting in disasters such as landslides  that  cost  lives  and  resources,  and  droughts  that  adversely  affect  agricultural  output  Other  threats  to  the  environment  take  the  form  of  depletion  of  bio-diversity,  degradation  of  ecosystems  such  as  swamps  and wetlands and pollution of waterways Rwanda will continue to put  in place strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change by focusing  on  developing  eco-friendly  policies  and  strategies  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy and by promoting green growth    53 Science, technology and ICT  Rwanda  will  continue  to  invest  in  developing  adequate,  highly  skilled  scientists  and  technicians  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  the  transition  to  knowledge-based  economy  A  knowledge  based-economy  will  require  innovative  products  that  can  be  competitive  in  regional  and  global   17  markets Having laid the foundations for ICT to take-off in the country  through  the  laying  of  the  fibre  optic  cable  network,  Rwandans  have  a  whole new world of opportunities to take advantage of More importantly  the government of Rwanda will encourage the use of ICT as a tool for  self  employment,  innovation  and  job  creation  Policies  to  encourage  development  of  smart  applications  that  meet  economic  needs  and  develop economic potential will be promoted amongst the youth ICT as  a tool for improving service delivery in both the private and public sector  will be emphasized    18  6 THe ROAD MAP  This  roadmap  lays  out  how  Rwanda’s  Vision  2020  will  be  realized   through    the    country’s  planning  process  It  also  establishes  a  set  of  yardsticks against which we can measure our progress towards achieving  the targets Macroeconomic projections and the underlying assumptions  clearly showing the requirements to realize the Vision are also made  61 Rwanda’s planning process and the realization of Vision 2020  To  ensure  smooth  implementation  of  Vision  2020  and  achievement  of  the aspirations described above, it will have to be reflected in the whole  planning process and, particularly, medium-term operational instruments   Therefore,  the  long-term  aspirations  of  the  Vision  will  translate  into  medium -term Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies  (EDPRS) at the national level   The  EDPRS  is  operationalized  through  sector  strategies  and  district  development plans The sector strategies and the district development  plans are implemented through the Medium-Term Expenditure   Framework    (MTEF); three- year fully integrated budgets that mainstream the Public  Investment Programs (PIP) of the agencies and translate into concrete  action  plans,  costed  through  annual  budgets  The  poverty  reduction  achieved through  the  MTEF  will  be  monitored  and  will  feed  back   into  the  elaboration  of  sector  and district plans   19  Figure 2: Converting vision 2020 into a reality           Vision 2020                                                  Annual    action    plans           Sector strategies   District development   plans   Annual  action  plans      Monitoring and   Evaluation   62 Achieving Vision 2020: Macroeconomic assumptions and             projections     The implementation of Vision 2020 strongly holds onto the necessity to  achieve the aspirations of the Rwandan people, by markedly transforming  the  economy,  turning  the  country  into  a  middle-income  country  and  parting away with extreme poverty  EDPRS          MTEFs   Annual  Budget     20  Inspired by recent robust economic performance and remarkable progress  in  reducing  poverty,  assumptions  for  the  macroeconomic  perspectives  over the period until 2020 were made, aiming at more robust growth and  more ambitious objectives  Notwithstanding the existing macroeconomic challenges stemming from  both internal and external imbalances with still sizeable aid dependence  and a large trade balance deficit, the Vision’s macroeconomic assumptions  aim for an annual average real GDP growth of 115 percent, GDP per capita  of USD 1,240, gradual but sustained improvement in the external trade  balance, higher investments and savings, and a stronger financial sector  With real GDP expected to grow on average by 115 percent per year (real  output  growth  between  2000  and  2011  was  on  average  83  percent  a  year), agriculture would need to grow by at least 85 percent and reach  about  25  percent  of  total  output  (agriculture  grew  on  average  by  56  percent a year between 2000 and 2011 and amounted to 32 percent of  total output in 2011) The industry is expected to grow by 14 percent on  average and reach about 20 percent of total output (industry grew on  average  by  95  percent  a  year  between  2000  and  2011  and  amounted  to 16 percent of total output in 2011) while services would be expected  to  continue  taking  the  lead,  growing  by  135  percent  on  average  and  expected to reach about 55 percent of total output (services grew on  average  by  102  percent  between  2000  and  2011  and  amounted  to  46  percent of total output)  Increased investments will be needed to achieve the growth objectives  from  both  the  public  sector  as  well  as  the  private  sector  Domestic  investments are expected to expand, but this will need a stronger financial  sector to mobilize the necessary savings to finance those investments  Total  investments  are  expected  to  reach  30  percent  of  GDP  by  2020  (from about 21 percent of GDP in 2011) with the private sector gradually  taking a larger proportion, and savings are expected to reach 20 percent  of GDP by 2020 (from about 14 percent of GDP in 2011)  The scaled up investments in bottleneck-releasing infrastructure projects  that are expected to bolster competitiveness and further reduce external  trade  imbalances,  will  require  equally  substantive  financing  that  the  domestic savings mobilization efforts alone will not be able to cater for  While  a gradual  reduction in the reliance on foreign aid remains  a key  objective over the medium-term, domestic revenues – that nevertheless  are expected to significantly increase – will alone not cover all the required  public  investments  A  combination  of  highly  concessional  financing   21  (in  the  form  of  grant  financing  and  concessional  borrowing)  and  non- concessional borrowing that does not adversely affect Rwanda’s external  debt sustainability will be considered, while avenues leading to a greater  participation of the private sector will also be emphasized through public  private partnership ventures  In order to realize the targets set out, we will have to streamline planning  processes so that the Vision is translated into implementable plans, with  strong linkages between set priorities and the allocation of resources It  also requires a mobilization of a substantial financial resource from the  state, the donor community and the private sector If these resources can  be efficiently allocated through the planning process, the goals set in this  Vision will become attainable  63 Institutional framework for the implementation of Rwanda’s vision  The  implementation  of  the  Vision  2020  is  within  the  ambition  of  all  players:  the  state,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  NGOs,  decentralized  authorities,  grassroots  communities,  faith-based  organizations  and  development partners The top most policy making bodies of Vision 2020  implementation  is  the  Cabinet  and  the  National  Steering  Committee  (Ministers  and  Governors)  The  Permanent  Secretaries  (PS)  forum  and  Development  Partners  Coordination  Group  (DPCG)  oversee  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the  Vision  and  ensure  that  consensus  building  around Vision 2020 implementation is realized  The  Ministry  in  charge  of  Finance  and  Economic  Planning  coordinates  the implementation and monitoring and evaluation of the Vision It also  ensures that Vision 2020 targets are considered in Sector Strategies as  well as District Development Plans  The Ministry will specifically:  •\\t Coordinate  all  the  activities  related  to  the  implementation  of  the   Vision 2020  •\\t Mobilize and allocate resources to Vision 2020 priority areas  •\\t Support  the  planning  organs  and  other  institutions  in  charge  of   implementation of the Vision  •\\t Ensure  that  Vision  2020  based  sector  strategic  plans  and  district  developments  plans  are  prepared  and  linked  to  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure Framework and annual budgets  22  •\\t Ensure the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework   for the Vision  objectives and targets  •\\t Regularly report to Cabinet the status of achievement of Vision 2020   The  institutional  framework  for  implementation  of  Vision  2020  is  shown in the organization chart below  Cabinet  National Steering Committee  PS Forum & DPCG  Ministry of Finance and   economic Planning  23  Sector Working Group (SWG)  Joint Action Development   Forum (JADF)  CONCLUSION  Vision 2020  represents  an  ambitious  plan  to  raise  the  people  of   Rwanda    out    of    poverty    and  transform  the  country  into  a  middle-  income economy Some will say that this is too ambitious and that we  are not being realistic when we set this goal, others say that it is a dream  But, what choice does Rwanda have? To remain in the current situation  is  simply  unacceptable  for  the  Rwandan  people  Therefore,  there  is  a  need to devise and implement policies as well as mobilize resources to  bring about the necessary transformation to achieve the Vision This is  realistic based on the fact that countries with similar unfavourable initial  conditions  have  succeeded    The  development  experience  of  the  East  Asian ‘Tigers’ proves that this dream could be a reality  24  Annex  TABLe GUIDe  Annex 1: Key indicators of the Rwandan Vision 2020  No change made Revised indicators/targets New
